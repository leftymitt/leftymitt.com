Unethical human experimentation in the United States describes numerous
experiments performed on human test subjects in the United States that have
been considered unethical, and were often performed illegally, without the
knowledge, consent, or informed consent of the test subjects. Such tests have
occurred throughout American history, but particularly in the 20th century.

The experiments include: the deliberate infection of people with deadly or
debilitating diseases, exposure of people to biological and chemical weapons,
human radiation experiments, injection of people with toxic and radioactive
chemicals, surgical experiments, interrogation and torture experiments, tests
involving mind-altering substances, and a wide variety of others. Many of these
tests were performed on children the sick, and mentally disabled individuals,
often under the guise of "medical treatment". In many of the studies, a large
portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities or prisoners.

Funding for many of the experiments was provided by United States government,
especially the United States military, Central Intelligence Agency, or private
corporations involved with military activities. The human research programs
were usually highly secretive, and in many cases information about them was not
released until many years after the studies had been performed.

The ethical, professional, and legal implications of this in the United States
medical and scientific community were quite significant, and led to many
institutions and policies that attempted to ensure that future human subject
research in the United States would be ethical and legal. Public outrage in the
late 20th century over the discovery of government experiments on human
subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including
the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission, both of 1975 and the 1994
Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, among others.
