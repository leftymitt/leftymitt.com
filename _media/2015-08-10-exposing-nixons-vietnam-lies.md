After resigning over the Watergate political-spying scandal, President Nixon
sought to rewrite the history of his Vietnam War strategies to deny swapping
lives for political advantage, but newly released documents say otherwise,
writes James DiEugenio.  

Richard Nixon spent years rebuilding his tattered reputation after he resigned
from office in disgrace on Aug. 9, 1974. The rehabilitation project was
codenamed “The Wizard.” The idea was to position himself as an elder statesman
of foreign policy, a Wise Man. And to a remarkable degree – through the sale of
his memoirs, his appearance with David Frost in a series of highly rated
interviews, and the publication of at least eight books after that – Nixon
largely succeeded in his goal.
