The story is set in Japan a millennium from now. Five children - Saki, Satoru,
Maria, Mamoru and Shun - have been born and raised in a tranquil town that can
be described as a utopia overflowing with water and green foliage. The world is
ruled by people who have the "cursed power" or the "gods' power" of
telekinesis. After a certain incident, Saki and the others come to realize the
true nature of their world. Before long, they learn everything, including the
bloody history that brought humanity to this state. The five throw themselves
into life-threatening adventure and fight to protect friends and a world on the
brink of collapse.
