They are overwhelmingly white, rich, older and male, in a nation that is being
remade by the young, by women, and by black and brown voters. Across a
sprawling country, they reside in an archipelago of wealth, exclusive
neighborhoods dotting a handful of cities and towns. And in an economy that has
minted billionaires in a dizzying array of industries, most made their fortunes
in just two: finance and energy.

Now they are deploying their vast wealth in the political arena, providing
almost half of all the seed money raised to support Democratic and Republican
presidential candidates. Just 158 families, along with companies they own or
control, contributed $176 million in the first phase of the campaign, a New
York Times investigation found. Not since before Watergate have so few people
and businesses provided so much early money in a campaign, most of it through
channels legalized by the Supreme Courtâ€™s Citizens United decision five years
ago.
