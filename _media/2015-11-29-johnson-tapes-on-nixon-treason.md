Declassified tapes of President Lyndon Johnson's telephone calls provide a
fresh insight into his world. Among the revelations - he planned a dramatic
entry into the 1968 Democratic Convention to re-join the presidential race. And
he caught Richard Nixon sabotaging the Vietnam peace talks... but said nothing.  

After the Watergate scandal taught Richard Nixon the consequences of recording
White House conversations none of his successors has dared to do it. But Nixon
wasn't the first.  

He got the idea from his predecessor Lyndon Johnson, who felt there was an
obligation to allow historians to eventually eavesdrop on his presidency.  

"They will provide history with the bark off," Johnson told his wife, Lady
Bird.  

The final batch of tapes released by the LBJ library covers 1968, and allows us
to hear Johnson's private conversations as his Democratic Party tore itself
apart over the question of Vietnam.
