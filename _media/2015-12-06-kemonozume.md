Since ancient times there has existed a race of flesh eating monsters called
shokujinki (lit. "Man-Eating Ogres") that can assume human form or otherwise
live in the shadows while feeding on humans. The Kifūken (lit. "Ogre-Sealing
Sword") martial arts style school was created to hunt down those creatures and
its teachings have been passed down through the generations to the Momota
family. The story revolves around the forbidden romance between Toshihiko, the
latest heir of the Kifūken school and Yuka, a young woman who is also a
shokujinki.
