Peace talks between the Saudi-supported government of Yemen and the Houthi
rebels ended in late December without any agreement to end the bombing campaign
started by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies with US support last March. The
rationale for the Saudi-led war on Houthis in Yemen has been that the Houthis
are merely proxies of Iran, and the main alleged evidence for that conclusion
is that Iran has been arming the Houthis for years.  

The allegation of Iranian arms shipments to the Houthis - an allegation that
has often been mentioned in press coverage of the conflict but never proven -
was reinforced by a report released last June by a panel of experts created by
the UN Security Council: The report concluded that Iran had been shipping arms
to the Houthi rebels in Yemen by sea since at least 2009. But an investigation
of the two main allegations of such arms shipments made by the Yemeni
government and cited by the expert panel shows that they were both crudely
constructed ruses.
