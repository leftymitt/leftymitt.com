A twelve episode anime series featuring adaptations inspired by six short
stories from Japanese literature.  

1. No Longer Human, by Osamu Dazai: The path of a man with intense feelings of
   alienation towards society and the feeling of "humanity".  
2. Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita, by Ango Sakaguchi: A forest bandit finds
   a beautiful maiden in the forest and takes her to be his wife, but she is
more than she seems to be.  
3. Kokoro, by Natsume Soseki: A young man lives in Tokyo as a renter with a
   widow and her daughter. He invites his childhood friend, a monk, to come
live with him, hoping to help him. When the monk falls in love with the widow's
daughter, it drives a rift between them. The story is narrated from two points
of view, the man's and the monk's.  
4. Run, Melos!, by Osamu Dazai: A playwright writes a play based on the story
   "Run, Melos", and deals with his own feelings of betrayal towards his
childhood friend.  
5. The Spider's Thread, by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa: Kandata, a cruel and evil
   bandit is executed and lands in hell. The one good thing he had done in his
life was to not kill a spider he met in the city. The spider drops him a thread
to climb up into heaven. His elation is short-lived, however, as he realizes
that others have started climbing the thread behind him.  
6. Hell Screen, by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa: Yoshihide, the greatest painter in the
   country, is commissioned to draw his greatest work, an image of the king's
country inside his mausoleum. In the despotic king's realm, Yoshihide can see
nothing but the suffering of the commoners. He decides to make his last work a
tribute to the country as it really is.
