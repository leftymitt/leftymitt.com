Since 2013, a stream of disclosures has prompted reconsideration of
surveillance law and policy.  One of the most controversial principles, both in
the United States and abroad, is that communications metadata receives
substantially less protection than communications content.  Several nations
currently collect telephone metadata in bulk, including on their own citizens.
In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the privacy properties of telephone
metadata.  Using a crowdsourcing methodology, we demonstrate that telephone
metadata is densely interconnected, can trivially be reidentified, and canbe
used to draw sensitive inferences.
