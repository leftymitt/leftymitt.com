There’s a pile of money hiding offshore. It’s true that jobs are also leaving
the United States because American companies find it convenient to cut labor
costs by moving manufacturing abroad, the economic issue you’re hearing most
about in this election season. But the stunning amount of money that continues
to flow across American borders (and those of other countries), and eventually
disappears into the pockets of the corporate and political elite, ultimately
causes even more damage to our finances and our lives.

While the two leading candidates for the presidency, Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton, have indeed suggested cosmetic fixes for a situation that only grows
more extreme with the passage of time, they have themselves taken advantage of
numerous tax “efficiency” strategies that make money evaporate. Of course, you
shouldn’t doubt for a second that they’ll change their ways once in the Oval
Office.
