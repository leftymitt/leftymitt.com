Iranian leaders have reacted with fury to reports that newly declassified US
diplomatic cables revealed extensive contacts between Ayatollah Khomeini and
the Carter administration just weeks ahead of Iran’s Islamic revolution.

It was previously known that Ruhollah Khomeini, the charismatic leader of the
Iranian revolution, had exchanged some messages with the US through an
intermediary while living in exile in Paris. But new documents seen by the
BBC’s Persian service show he went to a great lengths to ensure the Americans
would not jeopardise his plans to return to Iran – and even personally wrote to
US officials.

The BBC’s reporting suggests that the Carter administration took heed of
Khomeini’s pledges, and in effect paved the way for his return by holding the
Iranian army back from launching a military coup.
