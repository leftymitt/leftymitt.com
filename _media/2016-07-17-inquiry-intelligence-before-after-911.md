While in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government. 
There is information, primarily from FBI sources, that at least two of these individuals were alleged by some to be Saudi intelligence officers. 
The Joint Inquiry's review confirmed that the Intelligence Community also has
information, much of which has yes to be independently verified, indicating
that individuals associated with the Saudi Government in the United States may
have other ties to al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups.
