 Attached are the flags from HRCâ€™s paid speeches we have from HWA. I put some
 highlights below. There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an
 extra scrub with Policy. In terms of what was opened to the press and what was
 not, the Washington Examiner got a hold of one of the private speech contracts
 (her speeches to universities were typically open press), so this is worth a
 read
