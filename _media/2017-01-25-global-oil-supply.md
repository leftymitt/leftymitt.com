Will mature field declines drive the next supply crunch?

Supply constraints seem a distant prospect in the current oil market, but a
return to balance in 2017 will leave the World with severely limited spare
capacity

Meanwhile, near term productivity gains are temporarily masking a steady
increase in mature field decline rates which could cut existing capacity by
>40mbd (>42%) by 2040e

We think risks of supply constraints will resurface long before risks of global
demand peaking, and a steady tightening in the supply/ demand balance post-2017
is behind our unchanged USD75/b long-term Brent price assumption
