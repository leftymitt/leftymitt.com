The FBI’s Rap Back program is quietly transforming the way employers conduct
background checks. While routine background checks provide employers with a
one-time “snapshot” of their employee’s past criminal history, employers
enrolled in federal and state Rap Back programs receive ongoing, real-time
notifications and updates about their employees’ run-ins with law enforcement,
including arrests at protests and charges that do not end up in convictions.
(“Rap” is an acronym for Record of Arrest and Prosecution; ”Back” is short for
background). Testifying before Congress about the program in 2015, FBI Director
James Comey explained some limits of regular background checks: “People are
clean when they first go in, then they get in trouble five years down the road
[and] never tell the daycare about this.”
