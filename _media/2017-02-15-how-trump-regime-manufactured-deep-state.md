President Donald Trump is not fighting a war on the establishment: he’s
fighting a war to protect the establishment from itself, and the rest of us.

At first glance, this isn’t obvious. Among his first actions upon taking
office, Trump vetoed the Trans Pacific Partnership, the controversial free
trade agreement which critics rightly said would lead to US job losses while
giving transnational corporations massive power over national state policies on
health, education and other issues.

Trump further plans to ditch the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(TTIP) between the EU and US, which would have diluted key state regulations on
the activities of transnational corporates on issues like food safety, the
environment and banking; and to renegotiate NAFTA, potentially heightening
tensions with Canada.

Trump appears to be in conflict with the bulk of the US intelligence community,
and is actively seeking to restructure the government to minimize checks and
balances, and thus consolidate his executive power.
