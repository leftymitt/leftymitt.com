Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks, it is the
largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.

The first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents and
files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center
for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory
disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates
in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.

Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including
malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote
control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection,
which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its
possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have
been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an
unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the
archive.

"Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert
hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized
exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include
Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs,
which are turned into covert microphones.

Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S.
National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now
infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force
â€” its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it
from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its
primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities.
