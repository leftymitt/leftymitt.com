Mainstream commentators display amnesia when they describe former FBI Directors
Robert Mueller and James Comey as stellar and credible law enforcement figures.
Perhaps if they included J. Edgar Hoover, such fulsome praise could be put into
proper perspective.

Although these Hoover successors, now occupying center stage in the
investigation of President Trump, have been hailed for their impeccable
character by much of Official Washington, the truth is, as top law enforcement
officials of the George W. Bush Administration (Mueller as FBI Director and
James Comey as Deputy Attorney General), both presided over post-9/11 cover-ups
and secret abuses of the Constitution, enabled Bush-Cheney fabrications used to
launch wrongful wars, and exhibited plain vanilla incompetence.
