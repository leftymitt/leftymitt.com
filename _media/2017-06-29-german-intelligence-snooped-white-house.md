Documents that SPIEGEL has been able to review show that the BND, until a few
years ago, actually had considerable interest in the United States as a target
of espionage. The document states that just under 4,000 search terms, or
selectors, were directed against American targets between 1998 and 2006. It is
unknown whether they continued to be used after those dates.
