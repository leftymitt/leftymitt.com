The evidence suggests that the barbaric Manchester bombing, which killed 22
innocent people on May 22nd, is a case of blowback on British citizens arising
at least partly from the overt and covert actions of British governments. The
British state therefore has a serious case to answer. We focus primarily here
on UK policies towards Libya but also touch on some of those related to Iraq
and Syria.
