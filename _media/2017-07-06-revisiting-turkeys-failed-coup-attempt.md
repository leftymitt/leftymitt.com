The buses stop half a kilometer short of the courthouse and the prisoners are
forced to disembark and walk the rest of the way. Each prisoner is flanked by
two guards, who force them to keep moving, while soldiers in battle gear, their
assault rifles at the ready, escort the proceedings. Demonstrators are crowded
behind a fence screaming "traitors!" and "murderers!" The screaming gets louder
the closer the prisoners get to the courthouse.

It is May 22, 2017, in Ankara and the Turkish state is indicting 221 men,
accused of having led the July 15, 2016, coup attempt against President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan. Twelve of the accused are either still at large or in exile,
including the man who Turkish authorities believe is the primary backer of the
putsch: Islamist cleric Fethullah GÃ¼len.
