It is, I promise, worse than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is
dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of
what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a teenager today. And
yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the
picture of global warming, and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic,
that they have occluded our perception of other threats, many much closer at
hand. Rising oceans are bad, in fact very bad; but fleeing the coastline will
not be enough.

Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their
lives, parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other
parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.
