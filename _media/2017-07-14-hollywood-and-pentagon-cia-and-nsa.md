Tom Secker and Matthew Alford report on their astonishing findings from
trawling through thousands of new US military and intelligence documents
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.

The documents reveal for the first time the vast scale of US government control
in Hollywood, including the ability to manipulate scripts or even prevent films
too critical of the Pentagon from being made — not to mention influencing some
of the most popular film franchises in recent years.

This raises new questions not only about the way censorship works in the modern
entertainment industry, but also about Hollywood’s little known role as a
propaganda machine for the US national security apparatus.
