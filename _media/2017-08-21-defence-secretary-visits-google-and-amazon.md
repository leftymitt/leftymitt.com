US Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a statement Wednesday that North
Korea would face the “destruction of its people” if it did not comply with the
demands of the United States.

The retired Marine Corps general, given the name “Mad Dog” for his bloody
conquest of the Iraqi city of Fallujah in 2004, issued this genocidal
proclamation as he was departing for a trip not to a forward operating base,
but to the headquarters of Amazon in Seattle and a Defense Department agency in
Silicon Valley that works closely with tech firms such as Google.

With the United States closer to nuclear conflict than at any point since the
end of the Cold War, Mattis’ visit was an indication of the increasingly vital
role played by the US tech giants not just in the conduct of wars abroad, but
in the censorship and suppression of political opposition at home.
