North Korea’s success in testing an intercontinental ballistic missile that
appears able to reach the United States was made possible by black-market
purchases of powerful rocket engines probably from a Ukrainian factory with
historical ties to Russia’s missile program, according to an expert analysis
being published Monday and classified assessments by American intelligence
agencies.

The studies may solve the mystery of how North Korea began succeeding so
suddenly after a string of fiery missile failures, some of which may have been
caused by American sabotage of its supply chains and cyberattacks on its
launches. After those failures, the North changed designs and suppliers in the
past two years, according to a new study by Michael Elleman, a missile expert
at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Such a degree of aid to North Korea from afar would be notable because
President Trump has singled out only China as the North’s main source of
economic and technological support. He has never blamed Ukraine or Russia,
though his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, made an oblique reference to
both China and Russia as the nation’s “principal economic enablers” after the
North’s most recent ICBM launch last month.
