This December will mark the 30th anniversary of the signing of the treaty
between the Soviet Union and United States on the elimination of intermediate-
and shorter-range missiles. This was the start of the process of radically
cutting back nuclear arsenals, which was continued with the 1991 and 2010
strategic arms reduction treaties and the agreements reducing tactical nuclear
weapons.

The scale of the process launched in 1987 is evidenced by the fact that, as
Russia and the United States reported to the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review
Conference in 2015, 80 percent of the nuclear weapons accumulated during the
Cold War have been decommissioned and destroyed. Another important fact is
that, despite the recent serious deterioration in bilateral relations, both
sides have been complying with the strategic weapons agreements.
