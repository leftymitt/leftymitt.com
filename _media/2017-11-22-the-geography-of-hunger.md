Currently, the nutritional epidemiological profile identified by Josué de
Castro, characterized by nutritional deficiencies (malnutrition, vitamin
deficiencies, endemic goiter, iron deficiency anemia, etc.), overlap with
chronic non-communicable diseases (obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemias, etc.).
However, the complex and paradoxical issue of hunger is a persistently
recurrent theme in Brazil. Given a series of current dilemmas, including the
planet's ecological sustainability and the need to guarantee the human right to
adequate, healthy nutrition, it is urgent to reawaken the struggle led by Josué
de Castro for the adoption of a sustainable economic development model and a
society free of poverty and hunger.
