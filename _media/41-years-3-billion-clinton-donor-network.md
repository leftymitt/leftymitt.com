A Washington Post investigation reveals how Bill and Hillary Clinton have
methodically cultivated donors over 40 years, from Little Rock to Washington
and then across the globe. Their fundraising methods have created a new
blueprint for politicians and their donors.  

LITTLE ROCK — Over four decades of public life, Bill and Hillary Clinton have
built an unrivaled global network of donors while pioneering fundraising
techniques that have transformed modern politics and paved the way for them to
potentially become the first husband and wife to win the White House.  

The grand total raised for all of their political campaigns and their family’s
charitable foundation reaches at least $3 billion, according to a Washington
Post investigation.  

Their fundraising haul, which began with $178,000 that Bill Clinton raised for
his long-shot 1974 congressional bid, is on track to expand substantially with
Hillary Clinton’s 2016 White House run, which has already drawn $110 million in
support.
