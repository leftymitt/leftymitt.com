Mr. Chairman:

Some, if not all, of the gentlemen on the other side of the House, who have
addressed the committee within the last two days, have spoken rather
complainingly, if I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week or
ten days ago, declaring that the war with Mexico was unnecessarily and
unconstitutionally commenced by the President. I admit that such a vote should
not be given in mere party wantonness, and that the one given is justly
censurable, if it have no other or better foundation. I am one of those who
joined in that vote; and I did so under my best impression of the truth of the
case. How I got this impression, and how it may possibly be removed, I will now
try to show. When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who, because
of knowing too little, or because of knowing too much, could not
conscientiously approve the conduct of the President, (in the beginning of it,)
should, nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on that
point, at least till the war should be ended. Some leading Democrats, including
ex-President Van Buren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I
adhered to it, and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think
I should still adhere to it, were it not that the President and his friends
will not allow it to be so. Besides, the continual effort of the President to
argue every silent vote given for supplies into an endorsement of the justice
and wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid paragraph in his late
message, in which he tells us that Congress, with great unanimity, (only two in
the Senate and fourteen in the House dissenting,) had declared that, “by the
act of the Republic of Mexico, a state of war exists between that Government
and the United States;” when the same journals that informed him of this, also
informed him, that when that declaration stood disconnected from the question
of supplies, sixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely, voted against
it; besides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth, what he could not
prove by telling the whole truth, demanding of all who will not submit to be
misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to speak out; besides all this, one
of my colleagues, [Mr. Richardson,] at a very early day in the session, brought
in a set of resolutions, expressly endorsing the original justice of the war on
the part of the President. Upon these resolutions, when they shall be put on
their passage, I shall be compelled to vote; so that I can not be silent if I
would. Seeing this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote
understandingly, when it should come. I carefully examined the President’s
messages, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point. The
result of this examination was to make the impression, that, taking for true
all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his
justification; and that the President would have gone farther with his proof,
if it had not been for the small matter that the truth would not permit him.
Under the impression thus made, I gave the vote before mentioned. I propose now
to give, concisely, the process of the examination I made, and how I reached
the conclusion I did.

The President, in his first message of May, 1846, declares that the soil was
ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico; and he repeats that
declaration, almost in the same language, in each successive annual
message-thus showing that he esteems that point a highly essential one. In the
importance of that point, I entirely agree with the President. To my judgment,
it is the very point upon which he should be justified or condemned. In his
message of December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly
true, that title, ownership to soil or anything else, is not a simple fact, but
is a conclusion following one or more simple facts; and that it was incumbent
upon him to present the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours, on
which the first blood of the war was shed.

Accordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve, in the message last
referred to, he enters upon that task; forming an issue and introducing
testimony, extending the whole to a little below the middle of page fourteen.
Now, I propose to try to show that the whole of this—issue and evidence—is,
from beginning to end, the sheerest deception. The issue, as he presents it, is
in these words: “But there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume
the ground that the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces, instead of
the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching our army to the east bank of
the latter river, we passed the Texan line, and invaded the territory of
Mexico.” Now, this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative. The
main deception of it is, that it assumes as true, that one river or the other
is necessarily the boundary; and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of
the idea that possibly the boundary is somewhere between the two, and not
actually at either. A further deception is, that it will let in evidence which
a true issue would exclude. A true issue, made by the President, would be about
as follows “I say, the soil was ours on which the first blood was shed; there
are those who say it was not.”

I now proceed to examine the Presidents evidence, as applicable to such an
issue. When that evidence is analyzed, it is all included n the following
propositions:

1. That the Rio Grande was the Western boundary of Louisiana, as we purchased
   it of France in 1803.

2. That the Republic of Texas always claimed the Rio Grande as her Western
   boundary.

3. That, by various acts, she had claimed it on paper.

4. That Santa Anna, in his treaty with Texas, recognised the Rio Grande as her
   boundary.

5. That Texas before, and the United States after annexation, had exercised
   jurisdiction beyond the Nueces, between the two rivers.

6. That our Congress understood the boundary of Texas to extend beyond the
   Nueces.

Now for each of these in its turn:

His first item is, that the Rio Grande was the Western boundary of Louisiana,
as we purchased it of France in 1803; and, seeming to expect this to be
disputed, he argues over the amount of nearly a page to prove it true; at the
end of which he lets us know, that by the treaty of 1819, we sold to Spain the
whole country from the Rio Grande eastward, to the Sabine. Now, admitting, for
the present, that the Rio Grande, was the boundary of Louisiana, what, under
heaven, had that to do with the present boundary between us and Mexico? How,
Mr. Chairman, the line that once divided your land from mine, can still be the
boundary between us after I have sold my land to you, is, to me, beyond all
comprehension. And how any man, with an honest purpose only of proving the
truth, could ever have thought of introducing such a fact to prove such an
issue, is equally incomprehensible.The outrage upon common right, of seizing as
our own what we have once sold, merely because it was ours before we sold it,
is only equalled by the outrage on common sense of any attempt to justify it.

The President’s next piece of evidence is, that “the Republic of Texas always
claimed this river (Rio Grande) as her western boundary.” That is not true, in
fact. Texas has claimed it, but she has not always claimed it. There is, at
least, one distinguished exception. Her State constitution—the Republic’s most
solemn, and well-considered act; that which may, without impropriety, be called
her last will and testament revoking all others—makes no such claim. But
suppose she had always claimed it. Has not Mexico always claimed the contrary?
So that there is but claim against claim, leaving nothing proved until we get
back of the claims, and find which has the better foundation.

Though not in the order in which the President presents his evidence, I now
consider that class of his statements, which are, in substance, nothing more
than that Texas has, by various acts of her Convention and Congress, claimed
the Rio Grande, as her boundary-on paper. I mean here what he says about the
fixing of the Rio Grande as her boundary in her old constitution, (not her
State constitution,) about forming congressional districts, counties &c. Now,
all of this is but naked claim; and what I have already said about claims is
strictly applicable to this. If I should claim your land, by word of mouth,
that certainly would not make it mine; and if I were to claim it by a deed
which I had made myself, and with which you had had nothing to do, the claim
would be quite the same, in substance or rather, in utter nothingness.

I next consider the President’s statement that Santa Anna,in his treaty with
Texas, recognised the Rio Grande, as the western boundary of Texas. Besides the
position so often taken that Santa Anna, while a prisoner of war—a
captive—could not bind Mexico by a treaty, which I deem conclusive; besides
this, I wish to say something in relation to this treaty, so called by the
President, with Santa Anna. If any man would like to be amused by a sight of
that little thing, which the President calls by that big name, he can have it
by turning to Niles’ Register volume 50, page 336. And if any one should
suppose that Niles’ Register is a curious repository of so mighty a document as
a solemn treaty between nations, I can only say that I learned, to a tolerable
degree of certainty, by enquiry at the State Department, that the President
himself never saw it any where else. By the way, I believe I should not err if
I were to declare, that during the first ten years of the existence of that
document, it was never by anybody called a treaty;that it was never so called
till the President, in his extremity, attempted, by so calling it, to wring
something from it in justification of himself in connection with the Mexican
war. It has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty. It does not call
itself a treaty. Santa Anna does not therein, assume to bind Mexico; he assumes
only to act as the President, Commander-in-chief of the Mexican army and navy;
stipulates that the then present hostilities should cease, and that he would
not himself take up arms, nor influence the Mexican people to take up arms,
against Texas during the existence of the war of independence . He did not
recognise the independence of Texas; he did not assume to put an end to the
war, but clearly indicated his expectation of its continuance; he did not say
one word about boundary, and most probably never thought of it. It is
stipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate the territory of
Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio Grande; and in another article it
is stipulated that, to prevent collisions between the armies the Texan army
should not approach nearer than within five leagues—of what is not said—but
clearly, from the object stated, it is of the Rio Grande. Now, if this is a
treaty recognising the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the
singular feauture of stipulating that Texas shall not go within five leagues of
her ownboundary.

Next comes the evidence of Texas before annexation, and the United States
afterwards, exercising jurisdiction beyond the Nueces, and between the two
rivers. This actual exercise of jurisdiction, is the very class or quality of
evidence we want. It is excellent so far as it goes; but does it go far enough?
He tells us it went beyond the Nueces, but he does not tell us it went to the
Rio Grande. He tells us, jurisdiction was exercised between the two rivers, but
he does not tell us it was exercised over all the territory between them. Some
simple minded people think it is possible to cross one river and go beyond it
without going all the way to the next, that jurisdiction may be exercised
between two rivers without covering all the country between them. I know a man,
not very unlike myself, who exercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between
the Wabash and the Mississippi; and yet so far is this from being all there is
between those rivers, that it is just one hundred and fifty two feet long by
fifty wide, and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either. He has a
neighbour between him and the Mississippi—that is, just across the street, in
that direction—whom, I am sure, he could neither persuade nor force to give up
his habitation; but, which, nevertheless, he could certainly annex, if it were
to be done, by merely standing on his own side of the street and claiming it,
or even sitting down and writing a deed for it.

But next, the President tells us, the Congress of the United States understood
the state of Texas they admitted into the Union to extend beyond the Nueces.
Well, I suppose they did-I certainly so understood it-But how far beyond? That
Congress did not understand it to extend clear to the Rio Grande, is quite
certain by the fact of their joint resolutions for admission expressly leaving
all questions of boundary to future adjustment. And, it may be added, that
Texas herself is proved to have had the same understanding of it that our
Congress had, by the fact of the exact conformity of her new constitution to
those resolutions.

I am now through the whole of the President’s evidence; and it is a singular
fact, that if any one should declare the President sent the army into the midst
of a settlement of Mexican people, who had never submited, by consent or by
force to the authority of Texas or of the United States, and that there, and
thereby, the first blood of the war was shed, there is not one word in all the
President has said which would either admit or deny the declaration. In this
strange omission cheifly consists the deception of the President’s evidence-an
omission which, it does seem to me, could scarcely have occurred but by design.
My way of living leads me to be about the courts of justice; and there I have
sometimes seen a good lawyer, struggling for his client’s neck, in a desperate
case, employing every artifice to work round, befog, and cover up with many
words some point arising in the case, which he dared not admit, and yet could
not deny. Party bias may help to make it appear so; but, with all the allowance
I can make for such bias, it still does appear to me that just such, and from
just such necessity, is the President’s struggle in this case.

Some time after my colleague [Mr. Richardson] introduced the resolutions I have
mentioned, I introduced a preamble, resolution, and interrogatories, intended
to draw the President out, if possible, on this hitherto untrodden ground. To
show their relevancy, I propose to state my understanding of the true rule for
ascertaining the boundary between Texas and Mexico. It is, that wherever Texas
was exercising jurisdiction was hers; and wherever Mexico was exercising
jurisdiction, was hers; and that whatever separated the actual exercise of
jurisdiction of the one from that of the other, was the true boundary between
them. If, as is probably true, Texas was exercising jurisdiction along the
western bank of the Nueces, and Mexico was exercising it along the eastern bank
of the Rio Grande, then neither river was the boundary; but the uninhabited
country between the two was. The extent of our territory in that region
depended, not on any treaty-fixed boundary, (for no treaty had attempted it,)
but on revolution. Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power,
have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new
one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right—a
right which, we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. Nor is this right
confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may
choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can may revolutionize,
and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit. More than this,
a majority of any portion of such people may revolutionize, putting down a
minority, intermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movement.
Such minority was precisely the case of the Tories of our own Revolution. It is
a quality of revolutions not to go by old lines, or old laws; but to break up
both, and make new ones. As to the country now in question, we bought it of
France in 18O3, and sold it to Spain in 1819, according to the President’s
statements. After this, all Mexico, including Texas, revolutionized against
Spain; and still later, Texas revolutionized against Mexico. In my view, just
so far as she carried her revolution, by obtaining the actual, willing or
unwilling, submission of the people, so far the country was hers, and no
farther.

Now, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence as to whether
Texas had actually carried her revolution to the place where the hostilities of
the present war commenced, let the President answer the interrogatories I
proposed, as before mentioned, or some other similar ones. Let him answer
fully, fairly, and candidly. Let him answer with facts, and not with arguments.
Let him remember he sits where Washington sat; and, so remembering, let him
answer as Washington would answer. As a nation should not, and the Almighty
will not, be evaded, so let him attempt no envasion, no equivocation. And if,
so answering, he can show that the soil was ours where the first blood of the
war was shed—that it was not within an inhabited country, or, if within such,
that the inhabitants had submitted themselves to the civil authority of Texas,
or of the United States, and that the same is true of the site of Fort
Brown-then I am with him for his justification. In that case I, shall be most
happy to reverse the vote I gave the other day. I have a selfish motive for
desiring that the President may do this; I expect to give some votes, in
connection with the war, which, without his so doing, will be of doubtful
propriety in my own judgment, but which will be free from the doubt, if he does
so. But if he cannot, or will not do this—if, on any pretence, or no pretence,
he shall refuse or omit it, then I shall be fully convinced, of what I more
than suspect already, that he is deeply conscious of being in the wrong; that
he feels the blood of this war, like the blood of Abel, is crying to Heaven
against him; that he ordered General Taylor into the midst of a peaceful
Mexican settlement, puropsely to bring on a war; that originally having some
strong motive—what I will not stop now to give my opinion concerning—to involve
the two countries in a war, and trusting to escape scrutiny by fixing the
public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory—that attractive
rainbow that rises in showers of blood—that serpent’s eye that charms to
destroy-he plunged into it, and has swept on and on, till disappointed in his
calculation of the ease with which Mexico might be subdued, he now finds
himself he knows not where. How like the half insane mumbling of a fever-dream
is the whole war part of his late message! At one time telling us that Mexico
has nothing whatever that we can get but territory; at another, showing us how
we can support the war by levying contributions on Mexico. At one time urging
the national honor, the security of the future, the prevention of foreign
interference, and even the good of Mexico herself, as among the objects of the
war; at another, telling us that, “to reject indemnity, by refusing to accept a
cession of territory, would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the
war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object.” So, then,
the national honor, security of the future, and every thing but territorial
indemnity, may be considered the no-purposes and indefinite objects of the war!
But, having it now settled that territorial indemnity is the only object, we
are urged to seize, by legislation here, all that he was content to take a few
months ago, and the whole province of Lower California to boot, and to still
carry on the war—to take all we are fighting for, and still fight on. Again,
the President is resolved, under all circumstances, to have full territorial
indemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we are to
get the excess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the whole
of the Mexican territory. So, again, he insists that the separate national
existence of Mexico, shall be maintained; but he does not tell us how this can
be done after we shall have taken all her territory. Lest the questions I here
suggest be considered speculative merely, let me be indulged a moment in trying
to show they are not.

The war has gone on some twenty months; for the expenses of which, together
with an inconsiderable old score, the President now claims about one half of
the Mexican territory, and that by far the better half, so far as concerns our
ability to make any thing out of it. It is comparatively uninhabited; so that
we could establish land offices in it, and raise some money in that way. But
the other half is already inhabited, as I understand it, tolerably densely for
the nature of the country; and all its lands, or all that are valuable, already
appropriated as private property. How, then, are we to make any thing out of
these lands with this encumbrance on them, or how remove the encumbrance? I
suppose no one will say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or make
slaves of them, or even confiscate their property? How, then, can we make much
out of this part of the territory? If the prosecution of the war has, in
expenses, already equalled the better half of the country, how long its future
prosecution will be in equaling the less valuable half is not a speculative,
but a practical question, pressing closely upon us; And yet it is a question
which the President seems to never have thought of.

As to the mode of terminating the war and securing peace, the President is
equally wandering and indefinite. First, it is to be done by a more vigorous
prossecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemies country; and, after
apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President drops down into a
half despairing tone, and tells us, that “with a people distracted and divided
by contending factions, and a government subject to constant changes, by
successive revolutions, the continued success of our arms may fail to secure a
satisfactory peace.” Then he suggests the propriety of wheedling the Mexican
people to desert the counsels of their own leaders, and trusting in our
protection, to set up a government from which we can secure a satisfactory
peace telling us that “this may become the only mode of obtaining such a
peace.” But soon he falls into doubt of this too, and then drops back on to the
already half abandoned ground of “more vigorous prossecution.” All this shows
that the President is in no wise satisfied with his own positions. First, he
takes up one, and, in attempting to argue us into it, he argues himself out of
it; then seizes another, and goes through the same process; and then, confused
at being able to think of nothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which
he has some time before cast off. His mind, tasked beyond its power, is running
hither and thither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding
no position on which it can settle down and be at ease.

Again, it is a singular omission in this message, that it no where intimates
when the President expects the war to terminate. At its beginning, General
Scott was, by this same President, driven into disfavor, if not disgrace, for
intimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months.
But now, at the end of about twenty months, during which time our arms have
given us the most splendid successes—every department, and every part, land and
water, officers and privates, regulars and volunteers, doing all that men could
do, and hundreds of things which it had ever before been thought men could not
do; after all this, this same President gives us a long message, without
showing us that, as to the end, he himself has even an imaginary conception. As
I have before said, he knows not where he is. He is a bewildered, confounded,
and miserably perplexed man. God grant he may be able to show there is not
something about his conscious more painful than all his mental perplexity!
