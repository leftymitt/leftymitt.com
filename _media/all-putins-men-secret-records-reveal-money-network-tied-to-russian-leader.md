For years there have been reports – mainly from whistleblowers – about Putin’s
secret wealth. A few offshore companies, a palace and a mega yacht have all
been said to belong to the Russian leader. Various news organizations have also
noted how the people around Putin have become rich. Yet a detailed picture of
the hidden financial affairs of Putin’s circle has remained elusive.

The records reveal what until now has mostly been the stuff of rumor: how
Putin’s cronies secretly conduct their business. The law firm’s internal files
show how minions and proxies created structures to hide and move the secret
wealth. The records include email correspondence, bank account forms, loan
agreements, share transactions and passport scans. Dates, cash amounts and
contract terms are detailed.
