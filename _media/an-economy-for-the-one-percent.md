The global inequality crisis is reaching new extremes. The richest 1% now have
more wealth than the rest of the world combined. Power and privilege is being
used to skew the economic system to increase the gap between the richest and
the rest. A global network of tax havens further enables the richest
individuals to hide $7.6 trillion. The fight against poverty will not be won
until the inequality crisis is tackled.
