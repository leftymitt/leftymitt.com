A bombshell White House memo has revealed for the first time details of the
‘deal in blood’ forged by Tony Blair and George Bush over the Iraq War.

The sensational leak shows that Blair had given an unqualified pledge to sign
up to the conflict a year before the invasion started.

It flies in the face of the Prime Minister’s public claims at the time that he
was seeking a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

He told voters: ‘We’re not proposing military action’ – in direct contrast to
what the secret email now reveals.

The classified document also discloses that Blair agreed to act as a glorified
spin doctor for the President by presenting ‘public affairs lines’ to convince
a sceptical public that Saddam had Weapons of Mass Destruction – when none
existed.

In return, the President would flatter Blair’s ego and give the impression that
Britain was not America’s poodle but an equal partner in the ‘special
relationship’.
