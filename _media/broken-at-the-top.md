Tax dodging by multinational corporations costs the US approximately $111
billion each year and saps an estimated $100 billion every year from poor
countries, preventing crucial investments in education, healthcare,
infrastructure, and other forms of poverty reduction.  US policymakers and a
broken international tax system enable tax dodging by multinational
corporations, which contributes to dangerous inequality that is undermining our
social fabric and hindering economic growth.
