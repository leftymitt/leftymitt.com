On April 3, 2014, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted to send the
Findings and Conclusions and the Executive Summary of its final Study on the
CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the President for declassification
and subsequent public release.  

This action marked the culmination ofa monumental effort that officially began
with the Committee's decision to initiate the Study in March 2009, but which
had its roots in an investigation into the CIA's destruction of videotapes of
CIA detainee interrogations that beganin December 2007.  

The full Committee Study, which totals more than 6,700 pages, remains
classified but is now an official Senate report. The full report has been
provided to the White House, the CIA, the Department of Justice, the Department
of Defense, the Department of State, and the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence in the hopes that it will prevent future coercive interrogation
practices and inform the management of other covert action programs.  

As the Chairman of the Committee since 2009, I write to offer some additional
views, context, and history.  

I began my service on the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2001. I
remember testimony that summer from George Tenet, the Director of Central
Intelligence, that warned of a possible major terrorist event against the
United States, but without specifics on the time, location, or method of
attack. On September 11, 2001, the world learned the answers to those questions
that had consumed the CIA and other parts of the U.S. Intelligence Community.
