Soft robots that can grasp delicate objects, computer algorithms designed to
spot an “insider threat,” and artificial intelligence that will sift through
large data sets — these are just a few of the technologies being pursued by
companies with investment from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital firm,
according to a document obtained by The Intercept. 

Yet among the 38 previously undisclosed companies receiving In-Q-Tel funding,
the research focus that stands out is social media mining and surveillance; the
portfolio document lists several tech companies pursuing work in this area,
including Dataminr, Geofeedia, PATHAR, and TransVoyant.
