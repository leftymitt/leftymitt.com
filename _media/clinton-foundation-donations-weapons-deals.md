Even by the standards of arms deals between the United States and Saudi Arabia,
this one was enormous. A consortium of American defense contractors led by
Boeing would deliver $29 billion worth of advanced fighter jets to the United
States' oil-rich ally in the Middle East.

Israeli officials were agitated, reportedly complaining to the Obama
administration that this substantial enhancement to Saudi air power risked
disrupting the region's fragile balance of power. The deal appeared to collide
with the State Department’s documented concerns about the repressive policies
of the Saudi royal family.

But now, in late 2011, Hillary Clinton’s State Department was formally clearing
the sale, asserting that it was in the national interest. At press conferences
in Washington to announce the department’s approval, an assistant secretary of
state, Andrew Shapiro, declared that the deal had been “a top priority” for
Clinton personally. Shapiro, a longtime aide to Clinton since her Senate days,
added that the “U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army have excellent relationships in
Saudi Arabia.”
