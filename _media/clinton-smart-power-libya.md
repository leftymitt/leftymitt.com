By the time Mahmoud Jibril cleared customs at Le Bourget airport and sped into
Paris, the American secretary of state had been waiting for hours. But this was
not a meeting Hillary Clinton could cancel. Their encounter could decide
whether America was again going to war.

In the throes of the Arab Spring, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was facing a furious
revolt by Libyans determined to end his quixotic 42-year rule. The dictator’s
forces were approaching Benghazi, the crucible of the rebellion, and
threatening a blood bath. France and Britain were urging the United States to
join them in a military campaign to halt Colonel Qaddafi’s troops, and now the
Arab League, too, was calling for action.

President Obama was deeply wary of another military venture in a Muslim
country. Most of his senior advisers were telling him to stay out. Still, he
dispatched Mrs. Clinton to sound out Mr. Jibril, a leader of the Libyan
opposition. Their late-night meeting on March 14, 2011, would be the first
chance for a top American official to get a sense of whom, exactly, the United
States was being asked to support.

In her suite at the Westin, she and Mr. Jibril, a political scientist with a
doctorate from the University of Pittsburgh, spoke at length about the
fast-moving military situation in Libya. But Mrs. Clinton was clearly also
thinking about Iraq, and its hard lessons for American intervention.
