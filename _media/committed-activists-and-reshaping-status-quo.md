The role of committed minorities in shaping public opinion has been recently
addressed with the help of multiagent models. However, previous studies focused
on homogeneous populations where zealots stand out only for their stubbornness.
Here we consider the more general case in which individuals are characterized
by different propensities to communicate. In particular, we correlate
commitment with a higher tendency to push an opinion, acknowledging the fact
that individuals with unwavering dedication to a cause are also more active in
their attempts to promote their message. We show that these activists are not
only more efficient in spreading their message but that their efforts require
an order of magnitude fewer individuals than a randomly selected committed
minority to bring the population over to a new consensus. Finally, we address
the role of communities, showing that partisan divisions in the society can
make it harder for committed individuals to flip the status-quo social
consensus.
