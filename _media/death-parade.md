Whenever two people on Earth die at the same time, they are sent to one of many
mysterious bars run by bartenders serving as arbiters. There, they must
participate in Death Games with their lives on the line, the results of which
reveal what secrets led them to their situation and what their fate will be
afterwards, with the arbiters judging if their souls will either be sent for
reincarnation or banished into the void. The series follows Decim, the lone
bartender of the Quindecim bar, whose role in judging these souls changes when
he meets a curious black-haired woman.
