My earliest recollection of national politics dates back exactly 60 years to
the moment, in the summer of 1956, when I watched the political conventions in
the company of that wondrous new addition to our family, television.  My
parents were supporting President Dwight D. Eisenhower for a second term and
that was good enough for me.  Even as a youngster, I sensed that Ike, the
former supreme commander of allied forces in Europe in World War II, was
someone of real stature.  In a troubled time, he exuded authority and
self-confidence.  By comparison, Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson came
across as vaguely suspect.  Next to the five-star incumbent, he seemed soft,
even foppish, and therefore not up to the job.  So at least it appeared to a
nine-year-old living in Chicagoland.

Of the seamy underside of politics I knew nothing, of course.  On the surface,
all seemed reassuring.  As if by divine mandate, two parties vied for power.
The views they represented defined the allowable range of opinion.  The outcome
of any election expressed the collective will of the people and was to be
accepted as such.  That I was growing up in the best democracy the world had
ever known -- its very existence a daily rebuke to the enemies of freedom --
was beyond question.

Naïve?  Embarrassingly so.  Yet how I wish that Election Day in November 2016
might present Americans with something even loosely approximating the
alternatives available to them in November 1956.  Oh, to choose once more
between an Ike and an Adlai.
