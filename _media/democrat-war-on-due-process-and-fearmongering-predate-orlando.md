Before the bodies were removed from the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last week,
Democrats began eagerly exploiting that atrocity to demand a new, secret
“terrorist watchlist”: something that was once the domestic centerpiece of the
Bush/Cheney war-on-terror mentality. Led by their propaganda outlet, Center for
American Progress (CAP), Democrats now want to empower the Justice Department —
without any judicial adjudication — to unilaterally bar citizens who have not
been charged with (let alone convicted of) any crime from purchasing guns.

Worse than the measure itself is the rancid rhetoric they are using. To justify
this new list, Democrats, in unison, are actually arguing that the U.S.
government must constrain people whom they are now calling “potential
terrorists.” Just spend a moment pondering how creepy and Orwellian that phrase
is in the context of government designations.
