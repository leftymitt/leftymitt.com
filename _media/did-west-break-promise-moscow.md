Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has accused the West of breaking promises
made after the fall of the Iron Curtain, saying that NATO's expansion into
Eastern Europe violated commitments made during the negotiations over German
reunification. Newly discovered documents from Western archives support the
Russian position.  

No one in Russia can vent his anger over NATO's eastward expansion quite as
vehemently as Viktor Baranez. The popular columnist with the tabloid
Komsomolskaya Pravda ("Komsomol Truth"), which has a readership of millions, is
fond of railing against the "insidious and reckless" Western military alliance.
Russia, Baranez writes, must finally stop treating NATO as a partner.  

Baranez, a retired colonel who was the Defense Ministry's spokesman under
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, asks why Russia should even consider
joint maneuvers after being deceived by the West. NATO, he writes, "has pushed
its way right up to our national borders with its guns." He also argues that,
in doing so, NATO has broken all the promises it made during the process of
German reunification.
