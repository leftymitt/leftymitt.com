Amid the endless demonization of Russian President Putin, David Brooks and
other upscale U.S. pundits have taken to misrepresenting the views of several
Russian philosophers whom Putin is known to admire, apparently following the
theory that whatever Putin likes must be evil, as Paul R. Grenier explains.  

What started the new Cold War? According to the State Department, it was
Russia’s illegal violation of Ukraine’s sovereign borders. The Kremlin, for its
part, insists it was a U.S.-facilitated coup in Ukraine which destroyed the
constitutional order there, causing chaos and dangers to Russian security to
which Russia had no choice but to respond.  

According to academic foreign policy “realists,” the cause was the imminent
threat of Ukraine’s integration into an ever-expanding military pact dominated
by the United States. According to George Friedman, president of Statfor, the
private strategic intelligence firm, the Ukraine crisis itself is more effect
than cause: the conflict started in 2013 when the United States decided
Russia’s increasing power was becoming a threat.
