In Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, 2016 has begun much as 2015
ended — with unacceptable levels of violence and a polarized public discourse.
That polarization showed itself in the halls of the United Nations last week
when I pointed out a simple truth: History proves that people will always
resist occupation.

Some sought to shoot the messenger — twisting my words into a misguided
justification for violence. The stabbings, vehicle rammings and other attacks
by Palestinians targeting Israeli civilians are reprehensible. So, too, are the
incitement of violence and the glorification of killers.

Nothing excuses terrorism. I condemn it categorically.  It is inconceivable,
though, that security measures alone will stop the violence. As I warned the
Security Council last week, Palestinian frustration and grievances are growing
under the weight of nearly a half-century of occupation. Ignoring this won’t
make it disappear. No one can deny that the everyday reality of occupation
provokes anger and despair, which are major drivers of violence and extremism
and undermine any hope of a negotiated two-state solution.
