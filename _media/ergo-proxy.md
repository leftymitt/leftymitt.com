The story begins in a futuristic domed city called Romdeau, built to protect
its citizens after a global ecological disaster thousands of years prior. In
this utopia, humans and androids known as AutoReivs coexist peacefully under a
total management system. A series of murders committed by robots and AutoReivs
infected with the Cogito virus (which causes them to become self-aware) begins
to threaten the delicate balance of Romdeau's social order. Behind the scenes,
the government has been conducting secret experiments on a mysterious humanoid
life form called a "Proxy." The Proxy beings (described as almighty, god-like,
immortal, omnipotent) are believed to hold the very key to the survival of
humanity.
