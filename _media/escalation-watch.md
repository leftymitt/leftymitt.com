Within months of taking office, President Donald Trump is likely to face one or
more major international crises, possibly entailing a risk of nuclear
escalation. Not since the end of the Cold War has a new chief executive been
confronted with as many potential flashpoints involving such a risk of
explosive conflict. This proliferation of crises has been brewing for some
time, but the situation appears especially ominous now given Trump’s pledge to
bring American military force swiftly to bear on any threats of foreign
transgression. With so much at risk, it’s none too soon to go on a permanent
escalation watch, monitoring the major global hotspots for any sign of imminent
flare-ups, hoping that early warnings (and the outcry that goes with them)
might help avert catastrophe.

Looking at the world today, four areas appear to pose an especially high risk
of sudden crisis and conflict: North Korea, the South China Sea, the Baltic Sea
region, and the Middle East. Each of them has been the past site of recurring
clashes, and all are primed to explode early in the Trump presidency.

Why are we seeing so many potential crises now? Is this period really different
from earlier presidential transitions?

It’s true that the changeover from one presidential administration to another
can be a time of global uncertainty, given America’s pivotal importance in
world affairs and the natural inclination of rival powers to test the mettle of
the country’s new leader. There are, however, other factors that make this
moment particularly worrisome, including the changing nature of the world
order, the personalities of its key leaders, and an ominous shift in military
doctrine.
