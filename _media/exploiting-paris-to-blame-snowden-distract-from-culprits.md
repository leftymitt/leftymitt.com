Whistleblowers are always accused of helping America’s enemies (top Nixon aides
accused Daniel Ellsberg of being a Soviet spy and causing the deaths of
Americans with his leak); it’s just the tactical playbook that’s automatically
used. So it’s of course unsurprising that ever since Edward Snowden’s
whistleblowing enabled newspapers around the world to report on secretly
implemented programs of mass surveillance, he has been accused by “officials”
and their various media allies of Helping The Terrorists™.  

Still, I was a bit surprised just by how quickly and blatantly — how
shamelessly — some of them jumped to exploit the emotions prompted by the
carnage in France to blame Snowden: doing so literally as the bodies still lay
on the streets of Paris. At first, the tawdry exploiters were the likes of
crazed ex-intelligence officials (former CIA chief James Woolsey, who once said
Snowden “should be hanged by his neck until he is dead” and now has deep ties
to private NSA contractors, along with Iran–obsessed Robert Baer); former
Bush/Cheney apparatchiks (ex-White House spokesperson and current Fox
personality Dana Perino); right-wing polemicists fired from BuzzFeed for
plagiarism; and obscure Fox News comedians (Perino’s co-host). So it was worth
ignoring save for the occasional Twitter retort.
