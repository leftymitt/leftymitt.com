Under the feudal mode of production, peasants were often allowed to cultivate
plots of land for themselves on a rental basis. However, those tenant farmers
rarely succeeded in becoming landowners in their own rights because a major
share of what they harvested was taken away by landlords as rent, often leaving
them with a bare subsistence amount of what they produced. When the harvest was
poor, they incurred debt. If peasants were unable to pay off their debts, they
could find themselves reduced to the condition of serfs or slaves.  

Today, under conditions of market dominance by parasitic finance capital, a
similar relationship can be detected between the powerful financial oligarchs
(as feudal lords of our time), on the one hand, and the public at large (as
peasant population of today), on the other. In the same manner as the landed
aristocracy of times past extracted rent by virtue of monopolistic ownership of
land, so today the financial oligarchy extracts interest and other financial
charges by virtue of having concentrated the major bulk of national resources
in their hands in the form of finance capital.
