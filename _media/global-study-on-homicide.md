The Global Study on Homicide 2013 seeks to shed  light on the worst of crimes —
the intentional killing of one human being by another.  

Beyond resulting in the deaths of nearly half a million people in 2012, this
form of violent crime has a broad impact on security — and the perception of
security — across all societies. This study, which builds on the
ground-breaking work of UNODC’s first Global Study on Homicide in 2011, is
particularly timely as the international community is engaged in defining the
post-2015 development agenda. As United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
has made clear, development progress cannot be achieved or sustained amid
violence, insecurity and injustice.  

By improving understanding of the underlying patterns and trends related to
different forms, settings and risk factors of homicide at the global, regional,
national and sub-national levels, this study can be a strategic tool in
supporting governments’ efforts to address root causes and enhance criminal
justice responses. 

Alongside intentional homicide related to other criminal activities and
socio-political agendas, the study examines homicide related to interpersonal
conflict, which includes homicides perpetrated by intimate partners or family
members. Unlike other forms of homicide, which vary significantly across
regions and from year to year, intimate partner and family-related homicide
remains persistent and prevalent.
