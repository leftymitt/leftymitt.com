Eric Schmidt is an influential figure, even among the parade of powerful
characters with whom I have had to cross paths since I founded WikiLeaks. In
mid-May 2011 I was under house arrest in rural Norfolk, about three hours’
drive northeast of London. The crackdown against our work was in full swing and
every wasted moment seemed like an eternity. It was hard to get my attention.
But when my colleague Joseph Farrell told me the executive chairman of Google
wanted to make an appointment with me, I was listening.

In some ways the higher echelons of Google seemed more distant and obscure to
me than the halls of Washington. We had been locking horns with senior US
officials for years by that point. The mystique had worn off. But the power
centers growing up in Silicon Valley were still opaque and I was suddenly
conscious of an opportunity to understand and influence what was becoming the
most influential company on earth. Schmidt had taken over as CEO of Google in
2001 and built it into an empire.
