Greenpeace Netherlands has released secret TTIP negotiation documents. We have
done so to provide much needed transparency and trigger an informed debate on
the treaty. This treaty is threatening to have far reaching implications for
the environment and the lives of more than 800 million citizens in the EU and
US.

Whether you care about environmental issues, animal welfare, labour rights or
internet privacy, you should be concerned about what is in these leaked
documents. They underline the strong objections civil society and millions of
people around the world have voiced: TTIP is about a huge transfer of power
from people to big business.

You can download all the documents below, as a whole and per chapter. For more
background info on the content of these documents and TTIP in general, please
