Higurashi no Naku Koro ni takes place during June 1983 in a fictional rural
village called Hinamizawa which has a population of approximately 2,000. The
main character, Keiichi Maebara, moves to Hinamizawa and befriends his new
classmates Rena Ryugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude, and Satoko Houjou. Keiichi
joins their after-school club activities, which consist mostly of card and
board games (and punishment games for the loser â€“ usually him). Hinamizawa
appears to be a normal, peaceful, rural village to Keiichi. However, the
tranquility abruptly ends after the annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration
to commemorate and give thanks to the local god, Oyashiro. Keiichi learns that
every year for the past four years, one person has been murdered and another
has gone missing on the evening of the Watanagashi Festival. Keiichi himself
soon becomes drawn into the strange events surrounding the Watanagashi Festival
and Oyashiro. In each story arc, he or one of his friends becomes paranoid, and
a crime is committed. Usually, the crime involves the murder of one of their
own friends. While it seems impossible to tell their delusions apart from the
mystery of Hinamizawa, slowly the truth is revealed.
