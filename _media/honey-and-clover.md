Yūta Takemoto, Takumi Mayama and Shinobu Morita are three young men who live in
the same apartment complex and are students at an art college in Tokyo.

One day, they are introduced to Hagumi Hanamoto, the daughter of a cousin of
Shūji Hanamoto, an art professor, who has come to live with Hanamoto and has
become a first year art student at the art school that everyone attends. Yuta
and Shinobu both fall in love with Hagu, but Yuta hides his feelings and tries
to be a friend to Hagu while Shinobu expresses his love in ways that seem only
to scare Hagu, such as calling her "Mousey" and constantly photographing her.
Hagu herself, though initially timid and afraid of company, gradually warms up
to the three.

The group comes to include Ayumi Yamada, a master of pottery who is well known
by her nickname "Tetsujin" (Iron Lady), who becomes very close to Hagu. When
not at school, she helps run the family liquor store. While Ayumi is popular
with many young men, she falls in love with Takumi, who does not recipocrate
her feelings and considers her a very dear friend. Instead, Takumi pursues an
older woman, Rika Harada, a widowed friend of Professor Hanamoto who runs an
architecture studio she founded with her late husband.

The story follows these five characters in their love triangles, unrequited
love, graduating from college, finding jobs, and learning more about
themselves.
