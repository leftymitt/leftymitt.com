This paper provides a comprehensive, updated picture of energy subsidies at the
global and regional levels. It focuses on the broad notion of post-tax energy
subsidies, which arise when consumer prices are below supply costs plus a tax
to reflect environmental damage and an additional tax applied to all
consumption goods to raise government revenues. Post-tax energy subsidies are
dramatically higher than previously estimated, and are projected to remain
high. These subsidies primarily reflect under-pricing from a domestic (rather
than global) perspective, so even unilateral price reform is in countries’ own
interests. The potential fiscal, environmental and welfare impacts of energy
subsidy reform are substantial.
