I’m an expert on how technology hijacks our psychological vulnerabilities.
That’s why I spent the last three years as Google’s Design Ethicist caring
about how to design things in a way that defends a billion people’s minds from
getting hijacked.

When using technology, we often focus optimistically on all the things it does
for us. But I want you to show you where it might do the opposite.

Where does technology exploit our minds’ weaknesses?

I learned to think this way when I was a magician. Magicians start by looking
for blind spots, edges, vulnerabilities and limits of people’s perception, so
they can influence what people do without them even realizing it. Once you know
how to push people’s buttons, you can play them like a piano.
