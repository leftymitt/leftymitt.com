The nightmare scenario of U.S. geopolitical strategists seems to be coming
true: foreign economic independence from U.S. control. Instead of privatizing
and neoliberalizing the world under U.S.-centered financial planning and
ownership, the Russian and Chinese governments are investing in neighboring
economies on terms that cement Eurasian economic integration on the basis of
Russian oil and tax exports and Chinese financing. The Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) threatens to replace the IMF and World Bank programs
that favor U.S. suppliers, banks and bondholders (with the United States
holding unique veto power).  

Russia’s 2013 loan to Ukraine, made at the request of Ukraine’s elected
pro-Russian government, demonstrated the benefits of mutual trade and
investment relations between the two countries. As Russian finance minister
Anton Siluanov points out, Ukraine’s “international reserves were barely enough
to cover three months’ imports, and no other creditor was prepared to lend on
terms acceptable to Kiev. Yet Russia provided $3 billion of much-needed funding
at a 5 per cent interest rate, when Ukraine’s bonds were yielding nearly 12 per
cent.”
