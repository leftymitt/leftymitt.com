SEATTLE — On Monday mornings, fresh recruits line up for an orientation
intended to catapult them into Amazon’s singular way of working.

They are told to forget the “poor habits” they learned at previous jobs, one
employee recalled. When they “hit the wall” from the unrelenting pace, there is
only one solution: “Climb the wall,” others reported. To be the best Amazonians
they can be, they should be guided by the leadership principles, 14 rules
inscribed on handy laminated cards. When quizzed days later, those with perfect
scores earn a virtual award proclaiming, “I’m Peculiar” — the company’s proud
phrase for overturning workplace conventions.

At Amazon, workers are encouraged to tear apart one another’s ideas in
meetings, toil long and late (emails arrive past midnight, followed by text
messages asking why they were not answered), and held to standards that the
company boasts are “unreasonably high.” The internal phone directory instructs
colleagues on how to send secret feedback to one another’s bosses. Employees
say it is frequently used to sabotage others. (The tool offers sample texts,
including this: “I felt concerned about his inflexibility and openly
complaining about minor tasks.”)
