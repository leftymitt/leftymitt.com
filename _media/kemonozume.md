Since ancient times there has existed a race of flesh eating monsters called shokujinki (lit. "Man-Eating Ogres") that can assume human form or otherwise live in the shadows while feeding on humans. The Kifūken (lit. "Ogre-Sealing Sword") martial arts style school was created to hunt down those creatures and its teachings have been passed down through the generations to the Momota family. The story revolves around the forbidden romance between Toshihiko, the latest heir of the Kifūken school and Yuka, a young woman who is also a shokujinki.
