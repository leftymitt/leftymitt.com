One result of the great transformation we call the Industrial Revolution in the
northern hemisphere was the increasing scale of the European commercial,
political and military domination of societies and states scattered from
Morocco to Indonesia and from Central Asia deep into Africa. For convenience,
because of their location, their relative weakness and their Islamic
orientation, I called these Afro-Asian societies “the South.”

Because of the scale of the issues and peoples I am considering, I cannot hope
to deal with all aspects of my subject, or indeed with any part of it in
satisfactory detail, but I will endeavor to provide enough to give the reader a
basis to get an overview of the growth of thought in “the South.”
