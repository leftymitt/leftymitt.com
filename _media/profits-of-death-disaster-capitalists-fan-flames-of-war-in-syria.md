As a tentative ceasefire continues to hold in Syria, with the next round of
peace talks having resumed this week, you’d be forgiven for thinking that there
might be an end in sight to a conflict that has raged for nearly five years.

But as with every war in the Middle East, nothing is quite as it seems.

According to Naomi Klein in her book The Shock Doctrine, corporatist (a more
pertinent term for what many of us consider “neoliberal”) policymakers — those
that are inherently intertwined with both Government and multinational
companies — take advantage of catastrophes such as economic collapse,
hurricanes, terrorist attacks and even war, to further what she describes as
their “policy trinity”: the elimination of the public sphere, total liberation
for corporations and skeletal social spending.

In short, disaster capitalism is premised on a simple philosophy: where there’s
chaos, there’s money to be made.
