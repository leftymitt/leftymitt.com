On May 10, Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines, receiving
39 percent of the vote and besting his nearest competitor by more than 6
million votes. He was elected with a base of support particularly in the middle
class and upper-middle class, which he mobilized behind a right-wing populist
campaign.

Duterte is a fascistic political figure, the long-time head of death squads in
Davao City in the southern Philippines. At the center of his presidential
campaign was the repeated promise that he would have the police and military
kill alleged criminals. He also threatened to kill workers if they attempted to
form a union in Export Processing Zones.

Duterteâ€™s election is the product of mounting class tensions bound up with the
drive to world war, spearheaded by US imperialism, and is a sharp expression of
the move by capitalist ruling elites internationally toward dictatorial forms
of rule. It parallels the rise of the far-right worldwide, from the National
Front in France, to the AfD in Germany and the presidential candidacy of Donald
Trump in the United States.
