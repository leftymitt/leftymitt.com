Saudi Arabia has told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it
will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of American assets held by
the kingdom if Congress passes a bill that would allow the Saudi government to
be held responsible in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks.

The Obama administration has lobbied Congress to block the bill’s passage,
according to administration officials and congressional aides from both
parties, and the Saudi threats have been the subject of intense discussions in
recent weeks between lawmakers and officials from the State Department and the
Pentagon. The officials have warned senators of diplomatic and economic fallout
from the legislation.

Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, delivered the kingdom’s message
personally last month during a trip to Washington, telling lawmakers that Saudi
Arabia would be forced to sell up to $750 billion in treasury securities and
other assets in the United States before they could be in danger of being
frozen by American courts.
