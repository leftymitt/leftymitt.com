Concerned about the militarization of law enforcement, a source within the
intelligence community has provided The Intercept with a secret, internal U.S.
government catalogue of dozens of cellphone surveillance devices used by the
military and by intelligence agencies. Some of the devices are already in use
by federal law enforcement and local police forces domestically, and civil
liberties advocates believe others will eventually find their way into use
inside the U.S. This product catalogue provides rare insight into the current
spy capabilities of local law enforcement and offers a preview of the future of
mass surveillance of mobile communications.
