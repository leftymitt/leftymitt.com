Great social thinkers like Karl Marx, Engels, Nietzsche, Lenin and David Hume
have postulated the ‘death’ of religion in the face of philosophy, economy and
improved standard of living condition of humans. The argument holds that
suffering and social hardships make religion relevant in the society. Karl
Marx, in fact, canvassed for the abolition of religion because it is illusory
to genuine human happiness. For him, therefore, “The abolition of the religion
as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness”
(see, Social Theory: Marxism, retrieved from
http:/www.megaessay.com/viewpaper/16779.html). This philosophy and social
theory of religion have influenced contemporary social theorists and thinkers.
“Not least, Western-trained thinkers largely failed to foresee the resurgence
of religion, because they had made a series of wrong assumptions about the
place of religion in regimes of modernisation” (Ellis and Haar, 2004: 17).
Modernity will take care of religion and give it its deserved place in the
past. This is because the “practice of defining Western modernity in terms of
‘leaving religion behind’ has become common” (Willaime, 2006: 77; see also
Monod, 2002). Modernity promotes secularism which denotes liberation from the
‘growing worldliness of religion’. For Marcel Gauchet (cited in Willaime, 2006:
83) “Religious belief is ceasing to be political. It is abandoning its
time-honoured involvement in the form taken by human communities...This
emancipation from the initial framework that contained the agreement about our
world ushers us into a new age of politics and, more broadly, historical
action”. Beck (1992: 10) summarises modernity vis-à-vis religion thus: “In the
nineteenth century, privileges of rank and religious world views were being
demystified..."
