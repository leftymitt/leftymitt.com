Only hours after Donald Trump delivered his fascistic inaugural address, Senate
Democrats overwhelmingly voted with their Republican counterparts to confirm
recently retired Marine generals James “Mad Dog” Mattis and John Kelly to head
the departments of Defense and Homeland Security, respectively.

These votes came as the newly-installed president signed an executive order
potentially crippling the Obama administration's health care overhaul, setting
the stage for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act that could eliminate health
insurance for close to 20 million people over the next year.

While Obamacare is itself a reactionary counter-reform imposing increased costs
and decreased coverage on millions of workers for the benefit of the health
care industry, Trump and the Republicans are preparing to use its repeal to
dismantle Medicaid, the government program for the poor, impose even deeper
cuts in health care for working people, and escalate the attack on Medicare,
the government program for seniors.
