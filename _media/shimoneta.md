In a dystopian future, Japanese authorities are cracking down on any perceived
immoral activity from using risque language to distributing lewd materials in
the country, to the point where all citizens are forced to wear high-tech
devices called Peace Makers (PM) that analyze every spoken word and hand
motions for any action that could break the law.  A new high-school student
named Tanukichi Okuma enters the country's leading elite "public morals school"
to reunite with his crush and student council President, Anna Nishikinomiya.
However, Tanukichi quickly finds himself entwined with the perverted terrorist
"Blue Snow" when she kidnaps and forces him to join her organization, "SOX," in
creating and spreading pornographic material across the city.
