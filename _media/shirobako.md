A group of five best friends, Aoi Miyamori, Ema Yasuhara, Shizuka Sakaki, Misa
Tōdō, and Midori Imai, all go into the anime industry after their experiences
in the animation club of their high school, with the dream of working on an
actual anime together one day. The girls all go into different fields of
specialty: Ema is a key animator; Shizuka is a voice actress; Misa is a 3D
computer graphics operator; Midori, still a college student, aspires to become
a story writer; and Aoi is a production assistant, though she has no true idea
about what to pursue as a career. However, the girls experience various
obstacles in their careers: Aoi and Ema, new employees at animation studio
Musashino Animation, find themselves under extreme stress every day from their
demanding workloads as they work on company projects; Shizuka struggles to find
a voice acting job she can be satisfied with; and Misa experiences difficulties
in adjusting to her unsatisfactory workplace. The story largely follows Aoi as
she struggles to do her job by making all of the necessary deliveries and
coordinating efforts between other staff members involved in Musashino
Animation's projects.
