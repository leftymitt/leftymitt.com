In 2003, for the first time since the Second World War, the United Kingdom took
part in an invasion and full-scale occupation of a sovereign State. That was a
decision of the utmost gravity. Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a brutal
dictator who had attacked Iraqâ€™s neighbours, repressed and killed many of his
own people, and was in violation of obligations imposed by the UN Security
Council.
