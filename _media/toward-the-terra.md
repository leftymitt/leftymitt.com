The story takes place in the distant future sometime after the 31st millennium
where humanity exists under the rule of the political order controlled by
supercomputers known as Superior Dominance and the carefully selected humans
known as the Members Elite. Centuries before the story begins, the human race
came to the conclusion that war and pollution rendered life on Earth
unsustainable. Using warp travel the decision was made to leave a supercomputer
Artificial Intelligence and caretaker humans behind and colonize distant stars.  

Under the rule of Superior Dominance all humans are born in vitro and given to
carefully selected parents. At the age of 14, all children are put through
brainwashing where their memories are wiped by Superior Dominance and
overwritten to produce functional adults. A race of advanced humans with
psionic abilities called Mu (pronounced myuu, μ) has evolved, and the
supercomputers that control Superior Dominance make every effort to exterminate
them. Led by Soldier Blue and then Soldier Shin, the Mu make every effort to
locate and rescue as many Mu children as possible before they are discovered
and eliminated. The Mu have only one wish, to return to what they see as their
promised land, Terra.
