In accordance with section 105(c) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, this report, by the U.S. International Trade Commission (Commission or USITC), assesses the likely effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP, TPP Agreement, or the agreement) on the U.S. economy as a whole and on specific industry sectors. It encompasses TPP’s impact on the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP), exports, and imports; U.S. aggregate employment and employment opportunities; the production, employment, and competitive position of U.S. industries likely to be significantly affected by TPP; and the interests of U.S. consumers. The report also reviews other assessments of TPP’s economic effects available in the literature, and discusses areas of consensus and divergence between the Commission’s analyses and conclusions and those in the literature reviewed.
