In accordance with section 105(c) of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade
Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, this report, by the U.S.
International Trade Commission (Commission or USITC), assesses the likely
effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP, TPP Agreement, or the
agreement) on the U.S. economy as a whole and on specific industry sectors. It
encompasses TPP’s impact on the United States’ gross domestic product (GDP),
exports, and imports; U.S. aggregate employment and employment opportunities;
the production, employment, and competitive position of U.S. industries likely
to be significantly affected by TPP; and the interests of U.S. consumers. The
report also reviews other assessments of TPP’s economic effects available in
the literature, and discusses areas of consensus and divergence between the
Commission’s analyses and conclusions and those in the literature reviewed.
