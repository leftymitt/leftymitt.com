Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who will soon be running his global business
empire, took part in her father’s first official discussion with the president
of Argentina last week, according the Argentine leader.

President Mauricio Macri of Argentina told the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese
newspaper, that he had spoken with Ivanka Trump when he called her father to
congratulate him on his victory in the U.S. presidential election.

It was the second time in a week that Americans only learned that the
president-elect’s daughter had been involved in her father’s talks with a world
leader because of the routine transparency of a foreign government.

On Thursday, after Trump barred reporters from attending his meeting with Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, photographs released by the Japanese government
showed that Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, were present for the
meeting at Trump Tower.
