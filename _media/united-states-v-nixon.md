Following indictment alleging violation of federal statutes by certain staff
members of the White House and political supporters of the President, the
Special Prosecutor filed a motion under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 17(c) for a
subpoena duces tecum for the production before trial of certain tapes and
documents relating to precisely identified conversations and meetings between
the President and others. The President, claiming executive privilege, filed a
motion to quash the subpoena. The District Court, after treating the subpoenaed
material as presumptively privileged, concluded that the Special Prosecutor had
made a sufficient showing to rebut the presumption and that the requirements of
Rule 17(c) had been satisfied. The court thereafter issued an order for an in
camera examination of the subpoenaed material, having rejected the President's
contentions (a) that the dispute between him and the Special Prosecutor was
nonjusticiable as an "intra-executive" conflict and (b) that the judiciary
lacked authority to review the President's assertion of executive privilege.
The court stayed its order pending appellate review, which the President then
sought in the Court of Appeals. The Special Prosecutor then filed in this Court
a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment (No. 73-1766), and the
President filed a cross-petition for such a writ challenging the grand jury
action (No. 73-1834). The Court granted both petitions.
