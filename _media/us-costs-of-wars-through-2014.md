A full	
accounting	
of	
war's	burdens cannot be	
placed	
in	
columns	
on	
a	
ledger. 
From	
the	
civilians
harmed	
or
displaced	
by	
violence,
to	
the
soldiers	
killed	
and	
wounded,	
to	
the	
children	
who	
play	
on	
roads	
and	
fields	
sown
with
improvised
explosive
devices
and
cluster
bombs,
no	
set
of	
numbers
can
convey
the
human
toll	
of	
the	
wars	
in	
Iraq	
and	
Afghanistan
,	
or	
how	
they	
have	
spilled	
into	
neighboring	
states	
and	
come	
home	
to	
the	
US
.	
Yet
,	
the	
expenditures	
noted	
on	
government
ledgers
are	
necessary	
to	
apprehend
,
even	
as	
they	
are
so	
large	
as	
to	
be	
almost	
incomprehensible.  

Congress	
and	
the
Executive	
Branch	
describe	
the	
wars
as	
Overseas	
Contingency	
Operations	
(OCO).
The	
U.S.	
has	
spent
and	
taken	
obligations	
to	
spend
approximately	 
$4.4
trillion
on	
the
wars	
in	
Iraq,	
Afghanistan	
and	
Pakistan
not	
including	
the	
money	
requested	
for	
FY2015
.
The	
spending	
has	
occurred	
in	
several	
categories.	
A
large	
portion
of	
the	
costs
for	
these	
wars	
occur	
in	
OCO	
appropriations	
for	
the	
State	
Department	
and	
Department	
of	
Defense
(See	
Table	
1
and	
5
which	
includes	
the	
spending	
requests	
for	
FY2015
and	
the	
Appen
dix).

Although
the
U.S.	
war
in	
Iraq	
was	
of	
shorter	
duration	
than	
the	
ongoing	
combat	
operations	
in	
Afghanistan	
and	
Pakistan	
(known	
as	
AfPak)
,	
the	
Iraq	
War	
was	
comparatively	
more expensive.  

If	
one	
simply	
highlights	
the
budgetary
costs	
of	
allocations	
and	
expenditures	
so	
far,	
the	
U.S.	
has	
spent	
more	
than	
$1.5
trillion	
for	
combat	
and	
reconstruction	
in	
both	
major	
war	
zones
and	
for	
defense	
of	
US	
airspace
.	
Additional	
war
related	
spending
including
additions	
to	
the	
Pentagon	
base	
budget
and	
Veterans	
health	
and	
medical	
disability	
expenses
total	
about	
just	
under	
$1	
trillion.	
Thus,	
war	
and	
war	
related	
spending	
from	
2001	
through	
the	
end	
of	
fiscal	
year
2014
is	
about
$2.6
trillion.
