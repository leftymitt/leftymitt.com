A full accounting	of	war's	burdens cannot be	placed in columns on	a ledger.
From the civilians harmed or displaced by violence, to the soldiers killed and
wounded, to the children who play on roads and fields sown with improvised
explosive devices and cluster bombs, no set of	numbers can convey the human
toll of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or how they have spilled	into
neighboring states and come home to the US.  Yet, the expenditures noted on
government ledgers are necessary to apprehend, even as they are so large as to
be almost incomprehensible.  

Congress and the Executive Branch describe the wars as Overseas Contingency
Operations (OCO).  The U.S. has spent and taken obligations to spend
approximately $4.4 trillion on	the wars	in	Iraq,	Afghanistan	and Pakistan not
including	the money requested for	FY2015.  The spending has occurred in
several categories.  A large portion of the costs for these wars occur in OCO
appropriations for the State Department and Department of Defense (See Table 1
and 5 which includes the spending requests for FY2015 and the Appendix).

Although the U.S. war in Iraq	was of shorter duration	than the ongoing combat
operations in Afghanistan and	Pakistan	(known as AfPak),	the Iraq	War was
comparatively more expensive.
