This report lists hundreds of instances in which the United States has used its
Armed Forces abroad in situations of military conflict or potential conflict or
for other than normal peacetime purposes. It was compiled in part from various
older lists and is intended primarily to provide a rough survey of past U.S.
military ventures abroad, without reference to the magnitude of the given
instance noted. The listing often contains references, especially from 1980
forward, to continuing military deployments, especially U.S. military
participation in multinational operations associated with NATO or the United
Nations. Most of these post-1980 instances are summaries based on presidential
reports to Congress related to the War Powers Resolution. A comprehensive
commentary regarding any of the instances listed is not undertaken here. The
instances differ greatly in number of forces, purpose, extent of hostilities,
and legal authorization. Eleven times in its history the United States has
formally declared war against foreign nations. These 11 U.S. war declarations
encompassed 5 separate wars: the war with Great Britain declared in 1812; the
war with Mexico declared in 1846; the war with Spain declared in 1898; the
First World War, during which the United States declared war with Germany and
with Austria-Hungary during 1917; and World War II, during which the United
States declared war against Japan, Germany, and Italy in 1941, and against
Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania in 1942.  

Some of the instances were extended military engagements that might be
considered undeclared wars. These include the Undeclared Naval War with France
from 1798 to 1800; the First Barbary War from 1801 to 1805; the Second Barbary
War of 1815; the Korean War of 1950-1953; the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1973;
the Persian Gulf War of 1991; global actions against foreign terrorists after
the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States; and the war with Iraq in
2003. With the exception of the Korean War, all of these conflicts received
congressional authorization in some form short of a formal declaration of war.
Other, more recent instances often involve deployment of U.S. military forces
as part of a multinational operation associated with NATO or the United
Nations.
