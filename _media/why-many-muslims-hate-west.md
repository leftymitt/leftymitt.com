The issue of terrorist attacks on America has been so politically sensitive
that most commentators have simply wrapped themselves in the flag and closed
their eyes and ears. Yet, even in fairy tales, ostriches were never saved by
burying their heads in the sand. It is not a good defensive posture and it
wouldn’t be wise for real-life Americans to behave like make-believe ostriches.

If we want to be safe rather than sorry in the dangerous world we now inhabit,
we need to be clear-headed, logical and informed. Those characteristics do not
arise from anger or impulsiveness. They can arise only from sober assessment of
causes and intelligent evaluation of possible actions. Achieving these
qualities has become ever more necessary because we face an uncertain and
increasingly complex future.
