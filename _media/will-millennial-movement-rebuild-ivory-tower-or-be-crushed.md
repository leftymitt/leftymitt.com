Much of our future is reliably unpredictable, and what more so than the moments
when mass movements suddenly break out and sweep across our world? Who
expected, for example, that for perhaps the first time in history hundreds of
thousands of people would hit the streets of U.S. cities and towns -- and
millions the global streets from London and Barcelona to Sydney and Jakarta --
in early 2003 to protest the coming invasion of Iraq, a war, that is, that
hadn’t even begun? Or that such a movement would essentially vanish not long
after that war was predictably launched?

Who imagined that, in September 2011, a small group of youthful protesters,
settling into Zuccotti Park, an obscure square near Wall Street in downtown
Manhattan, would “occupy” it and so the American imagination in such a way that
“the 1%” and “the 99%” became part of our everyday language; Wall Street (as it
hadn’t been for decades) a reviled site; and “inequality” part of the national
conversation rather than just the national reality? Who imagined in the moment
before it happened that such a movement, such a moment, would then sweep the
country and the world, that streets and squares in American cities and those
around the world would be “occupied” and that global inequality would become,
and remain, an issue of import?
