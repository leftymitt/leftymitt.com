Random numbers, while impossible to generate algorithmically, can approximated
rather closely. While rigorous analysis of exactly how close any approximations
are and what shortcomings exist are a matter of ongoing research, the current
body of knowledge on the subject is quite immense. Take [this
paper](http://random.mat.sbg.ac.at/results/peter/A19final.pdf) as a starting
point.  

When using random numbers, one often needs to generate numbers within a range,
via sampling a set of integers, real numbers, etc.  Caution must be taken when
using custom methods not provided in the standard libraries or other
well-vetted ones. Hacky solutions can often cause otherwise random sets of
number to exhibit non-random properties. 


Take this common scenario:  

Suppose you want to generate a set of random numbers whose elements are between
0 and 1000, and your RNG outputs an integer between 0 and 34767. You come up
with a clever hack in `Bash`:  

    x_random = RANDOM mod 1000

Now, the space of [0, 32767] gets mapped down to [0, 1000]. See the results:  


{% highlight julia %}
srand(1234) # for reproducibility

modulus = 1000
rand_data = rand(1:32768, 1000000);
modulo_data = rand_data % modulus;
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight julia %}
using Gadfly

plot(x=modulo_data, Geom.histogram(bincount=modulus))
{% endhighlight %}

![Plot 1]({{ site.images }}/rand_dist_1.svg )

Seems random at first glance. Now, see what happens with a higher modulus:  


{% highlight julia %}
srand(1234)

big_modulus = 10000
rand_data = rand(1:32768, 1000000);
big_modulo_data = rand_data % big_modulus;
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight julia %}
using Gadfly

plot(x=big_modulo_data, Geom.histogram(bincount=big_modulus))
{% endhighlight %}

![Plot 2]({{ site.images }}/rand_dist_2.svg )

This result is decidedly non-random. The reason should be rather obvious at
this point. Mapping a random uniform distribution to a smaller space using a
modulus that is not a factor of the original space will cause some 'bins' to be
more likely to get valued mapped to them than others. The result: a non-uniform
random distribution.  

This isn't a complicated issue to deal with. RNG libraries of any respectable
programming account for this already. Just use library functions. 

In the event that such functions don't exist, always remember that quick, hacky
solutions can produce unintended effects that break the functionality you were
trying to achieve. 

In other words, two things: profile your scripts, and modulo division isn't
clever.  


{% highlight julia %}
scaled_big_modulo_data = ( rand_data / 32768  * big_modulus );
plot(x=scaled_big_modulo_data, Geom.histogram(bincount=big_modulus))
{% endhighlight %}
