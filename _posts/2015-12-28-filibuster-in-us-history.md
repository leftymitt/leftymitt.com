The filibuster is a parliamentary procedure where someone, rather than use
speaking time to contribute to a debate on some legislation before a vote,
speaks interminably so that the debate never concludes and the legislative body
runs out of time to get to a vote. This practice occurs in legislatures where
bills expire when deadlines are not met and where legislators where members
have unlimited time to speak, and it is a powerful tool to shutter debate on
specific issues or even drive the functioning of a body to a halt. 

### Examples 

In the United States, there have been many famous filibusters over the years
over serious political issues:

Like the filibusterers themselves, the filibuster itself is very polarizing.
Some consider it an embarrassment. Some [US Senators] go as far to call it the
'Soul of the Senate.' Recently in the United States, it has been [consistently
abused](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/01/gop-filibuster-record-rep_n_480722.html)
to prevent bills from passing, so much so that lawmakers have even voiced the
option to [revise existing
laws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-poised-to-limit-filibusters-in-party-line-vote-that-would-alter-centuries-of-precedent/2013/11/21/d065cfe8-52b6-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html)
to curtail the practice. 

One interesting aspect of the filibuster is *why* it's called a filibuster. The
history is somewhat surprising. 

### History

The word "filibuster" is original derived from a Dutch term for robber or
privateer (*vrijbuiter*), later adopted by the Spanish (*filibustero*) during
its colonial era. The Spanish used the word to describe freewheeling pirates
and privateers who raided Spanish colonies and merchant ships. As piracy
declined over the years, so did the usage of the word. This lasted until the
1850's, when much of Latin America was in colonial revolt. Governments,
colonial or otherwise, simply lacked the internal stability and power to
maintain order within their borders. Suspension of law and order restored an
environment that allowed brigands to flourish much as pirates had during the
16th century. 

By this time, major changes had taken place in the world. Spain had lost most
of its eminence in Europe and its power in its colonies. It had been
supplanted by France and, to a much greater extent, England and the United
States. These nations were in varying degrees in conflict with one another, and all sought influence or control over emerging Latin American nations. Establishing
control would benefit the controller materially, as much of Latin America
possesses considerable natural resources, and it would also destabilize
indigenous governments and prevent them from emerging as a competing powers
over time. Some efforts were overt, such as the US Mexican War in the 1840s and the
French invasion of Mexico in the 1860s, but others were not. 

Simultaneously, the eminent nations began to develop new political ideologies
that explained their own military and economic successes as reflective of their
own cultural superiority and the misfortunes of the rest of the world as
evidence of their cultural deficiencies. This mindset motivated much of the
positive opinions of Britain and its empire-building and the United States and
its westward expansion (Manifest Destiny).

Some individuals, motivated by national and/or religious fervor, took it upon
themselves to carry out what they believed to be the natural tendency of
history - the overthrow of Latin American governments in favor of
Anglo-dominated rule. *Filibuster*, a term that had originally been associated
with simple pirates, entered the English language to identify these
politically-motivated brigands who took arms against emerging indigenous
governments. 

The filibusters themselves were at times helped by their respective
governments, who intended to use them to carry out plausibly-deniable acts
against foreign nations, also known as false flag operations. The most
notorious example is William Walker, who travelled to Nicaragua to overthrow
the government with tacit support from the United States and, upon success, was
recognized as the legitimate leader of the country by the Pierce
administration. When local militias united against him, he was rescued and
returned to the United States by the British. This, among [many other
examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_%28military%29), reduced
many Latin American nations to decades of revolutions, government abuse, and
even anarchy. 

Of course, at this point, one may wonder how this relates to parliamentary
filibustering. 

The history is important because it establishes this - filibustering referred
to an illegitimate attempt by an individual for political reasons to undermine
and even usurp an existing government. This was noted within the United States,
and in the 1850s, the term was used to *pejoratively* describe people who
abused Senate rules to monopolize time and prevent action on legislation. 

Essentially, the practice that is now considered a legitimate debate tactic was
originally used as an insult to claim that its practitioners were undermining
the country.
