The filibuster is a parliamentary procedure where someone, rather than use
speaking time to contribute to a debate on some legislation before a vote,
speaks interminably so that the debate never conclused and the legislative body
runs out of time to get to a vote.  This practice occurs when a legislature has
limited time to vote on an issue but gives its members unlimited time to speak,
and it is a powerful tool to shutter debate on specific issues or even drive
the functioning of a body to a halt.  

### Examples 

In the United States, there have been many famous filibusters over the years on
serious political issues:

Like the filibusterers themselves, the filibuster itself is a polarizing
tactic. Some consider it an embarrassment.  Some go as far to call it the 'Soul
of the Senate.' Recently in the United States, it has been [consistently
abused](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/01/gop-filibuster-record-rep_n_480722.html)
to prevent bills from passing, so much so that lawmakers have even voiced the
option to [revise existing
laws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-poised-to-limit-filibusters-in-party-line-vote-that-would-alter-centuries-of-precedent/2013/11/21/d065cfe8-52b6-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html)
to severely limit the practice. 

One interesting aspect of the filibuster is *why* it's called a filibuster. The
history is somewhat surprising.  

### History

The word "filibuster" is original derived from a Dutch term for robber or
privateer (*vrijbuiter*), later adopted by the Spanish (*filibustero*) during
its colonial era.  The Spanish used the word to describe freewheeling pirates
and privateers who raided Spanish colonies and merchant ships.  As piracy
declined over the years, so did the usage of the word.  This lasted until the
1850's, when much of Latin America was in colonial revolt.  Governments,
colonial or otherwise, simply lacked the internal stability and power to
maintain order within their borders.  Suspension of law and order restored an
environment that allowed pirates to flourish in the 16th century. 

By this time, major changes had taken place in the world. Spain had lost most
of its eminence in Europe and its power in its colonies.  It had been
supplanted by France and, to a much greater extent, England and the United
States.  These nations were in varying degrees in conflict with one another,
trying to establish control new emerging Latin American nations.  Establishing
control would benefit the controller materially, as much of Latin America
possessed a considerable amount of resources, and it would also destabilize
indigenous governments and prevent them from emerging as a competing power
later on.  Some efforts were overt, such as the US wars with Mexico and the
later French invasion, but others were not.  Successful nations began to
develop new political ideologies that explained their own military successes as
reflective of their own cultural superiority and the conquered's misfortunes as
evidence of their cultural deficiencies.  This mindset motivated much of the
positive opinions of Britain and its empire-building and the United States and
its westward expansion (Manifest Destiny).

Some individuals, motivated by national and/or religious fervor, took it upon
themselves to carry out what they believed to be the natural tendency of
history - overthrow of Latin American governments in favor of Anglo-dominated
colonial states. *Filibuster*, a term that had originally been associated with
simple pirates, entered the English language to identify these
politically-motivated brigands who took arms against emerging indigenous
governments.  

The filibusters themselves were at times helped by their respective
governments, who intended to use them to carry out plausibly-deniable acts
against foreign nations, also known as false flag operations.  The most
notorious example is William Walker, who travelled to Nicaragua to overthrow
the government with tacit support from the United States and, upon success, was
recognized as the legitimate leader of the country by the Pierce
administration.  When local militias united against him, he was rescued and
returned to the United States by the British.  

Many other examples of this exist. The [wikipedia page
alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_%28military%29) lists William
Blount, Augustus W. Magee, George Mathews, George Rogers Clark, William S.
Smith, Ira Allen, William A. Chanler, James Long, and  Gregor MacGregor. The
combined effort of all of them reduced many Latin American nations to decades
of revolutions, government abuse, and even anarchy. 


Of course, at this point, you may wonder what this has to do with parliamentary
filibustering.  

The history is important because it establishes this - filibustering is an
illegitimate attempt by an individual for political reasons to undermine and
even usurp an existing government.  This was noted within the United States,
and in the 1850s, it was used to *pejoratively* describe people who abused
Senate rules to monopolize time and prevent action on legislation.  

Essentially, the practice that is a legitimate debate tactic gets its name from
an insult that its practitioners were undermining the country.
