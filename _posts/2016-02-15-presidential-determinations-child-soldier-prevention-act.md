The [Child Soldier Prevention Act of
2008](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/135981.pdf) was passed to
block the arms sales to any government, paramilitary, or other group that used
child soldiers in any capacity, including non-combat roles.  Built within the
law is the power for the president to determine at his discretion whether to
waive restrictions for any country that is documented using child soldiers. 

Barack Obama has invoked this waiver from 2011-2015 for the following
countries: 

 * [2011](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/04/presidential-memorandum-child-soldiers-prevention-act-2008):
   Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
 * [2012](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/28/presidential-memorandum-presidential-determination-respect-child-soldier):
   Libya, South Sudan, Yemen, DRC
 * [2013](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/30/presidential-memorandum-determination-respect-child-soldiers-preventio-0):
   Chad, South Sudan, Yemen, DRC, Somalia
 * [2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/30/presidential-memorandum-determination-respect-child-soldiers-prevention-):
   Rwanda, Somalia, Yemen, DRC, Central African Republic (CAR), South Sudan
 * [2015](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/29/presidential-determination-and-memorandum-determination-respect-child):
   DRC, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan 

Each waiver is made under the assumption that it is in the national interest of
the United States.  Precisely what that interest is does not need to be
disclosed. 

Some of the African countries are predominantly in the Sahel, and all have
increasing problems of fundamentalist Islamic
[insurgencies](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zJUFhYHoeIG4.kpQ_-iENfs9Y&hl=en_US).
The presidential waivers likely reflect American efforts to supply or sell
embattled governments with arms and materiel.
