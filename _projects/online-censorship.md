Onlinecensorship.org seeks to encourage social media companies to operate with
greater transparency and accountability toward their users as they make
decisions that regulate speech. Weâ€™re collecting reports from users in an
effort to shine a light on what content is taken down, why companies make
certain decisions about content, and how content takedowns are affecting
communities of users around the world.
