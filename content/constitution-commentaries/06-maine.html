 IN August, 1622, the council of Plymouth (which seems to have been
extremely profuse and inconsiderate in its grants 1) granted to Sir
Ferdinando Gorges and Capt.  John Mason all the land lying between the
rivers Merrimack and Sagadahock, extending back to the great lakes and
rivers of Canada; which was called Laconia.

 In April, 1639, Sir
Ferdinando obtained from the crown a confirmatory grant of all the land
from Piscataqua to Sagadahock and the Kennebeck river, and from the coast
into the northern interior one hundred and twenty miles; and it was styled
" The Province of Maine."

 Of this province he was made Lord Palatine,
with all the powers, jurisdiction, and royalties belonging to the bishop of
the county Palatine of Durham; and the lands were to be holden, as of the
manor of East Greenwich.  The charter contains a reservation of faith and
allegiance to the crown, as having the supreme dominion; and the will and
pleasure of the crown is signified, that the religion of the Church of
England be professed, and its ecclesiastical government established in the
province.  It also authorizes the Palatine, with the assent of the greater
part of the freeholders of the province, to make laws not repugnant or
</p>
<p>
 contrary, but as near as conveniently may be to the laws of England, for
the public good of the province; and to erect courts of judicature for the
determination of all civil criminal causes with an appeal to the Palatine.
But all the powers of government, so granted, were to be subordinate to the
"power and regement" of the lords commissioners for foreign plantations for
the time being.  The Palatine also had authority to make ordinances for the
government of the province, under certain restrictions; and a grant of full
admiralty powers, subject to that of the Lord High Admiral of England.  And
the inhabitants, being subjects of the crown, were to enjoy all the rights
and privileges of natural born subjects in England.

 Under these ample provisions Gorges soon established a civil
government in the province, and made ordinances.  The government, such as
it was, was solely confided to the executive, without any powers of
legislation.  The province languished in imbecility under his care; and
began to acquire vigour only when he ceased to act as proprietary and
lawgiver.

 Massachusetts soon afterwards set up an exclusive right and
jurisdiction over the territory, as within its chartered limits; and was
able to enforce obedience and submission to its power.
 <sup>

 It continued under
the jurisdiction of Massachusetts until 1665, when the commissioners of the
crown separated it for a short period; but the authority of Massachusetts
was soon afterwards re-established.

 The controversy between Massachu-
</p>
<p>
 setts and the Palatine, as to jurisdiction over the province, was brought
before the privy council at the same time with that of Mason respecting
New-Hampshire, and the claim of Massachusetts was adjudged void.

 Before a
final adjudication was had, Massachusetts had the prudence and sagacity, in
1677, to purchase the title of Gorges for a trifling sum; and thus to the
great disappointment of the crown, (then in treaty for the same object,)
succeeded to it, and held it, and governed it as a provincial dependency,
until the fall of its own charter; and it afterwards, as we have seen, was
incorporated with Massachusetts in the provincial charter of 1691.
