 AFTER Penn had become proprietary of Pennsylvania, he
purchased of the
Duke of York, in 1682, all his right and interest in the territory,
afterwards called the Three Lower Counties of Delaware, extending from the
south boundary of the Province, and situated on the western side of the
river and bay of Delaware to Cape Henlopen, beyond or south of Lewistown;
and the three counties took the names of NewCastle, Kent, and Sussex.

 At
this time they were inhabited principally by Dutch and Swedes; and seem to
have constituted an appendage to the government of New-York.

 In the same year, with the consent of the people, an
act of union
with the province of Pennsylvania was passed, and an act of settlement of
the frame of government in a general assembly, composed of deputies from
the counties of Delaware and Pennsylvania.

 By this act the three counties
were, under the name of the territories, annexed to the province; and were
to be represented in the General Assembly, governed by the same laws, and
to enjoy the same privileges as the inhabitants of Pennsylvania.

 Difficulties
</p>
<p>
 soon afterwards arose between the deputies of the Province and those of the
Territories; and after various subordinate arrangements, a final separation
took place between them, with the consent of the proprietary, in 1703.
From that period down to the American Revolution, the territories were
governed by a separate legislature of their own, pursuant to the liberty
reserved to them by a clause in the original charter or frame of
government.
