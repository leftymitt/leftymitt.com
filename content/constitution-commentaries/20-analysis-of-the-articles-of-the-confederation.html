<p>
 § 229.  IN pursuance of the design already announced, it is now
proposed
to give an analysis of the articles of confederation, or, as they are
denominated in the instrument itself, the " Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union between the States," as they were finally adopted by the
thirteen states in 1781.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 230.
 </b>
 The style of the confederacy was, by the first
article,  declared
to be, "The United Sates of America." The second article declared, that
each state retained its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every
power, jurisdiction, and right, which was not by this confederation
expressly delegated to the United States, in congress assembled.  The third
article declared, that the states severally entered into a firm league of
friendship with each other, for their common defence, the security of their
liberties, and their mutual and general welfare; binding themselves to
assist each other against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them,
or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other
pretence whatever.  The fourth article declared, that the free inhabitants
of each of the states (vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted)
should be entitled to all the privileges of free citizens in the several
states; that the people of each state should have free ingress and regress
to and from any other state, and should enjoy all the privileges of trade
and commerce, subject to the same duties and restrictions, as the
inhabitants; that fugitives from justice should, upon demand of the
executive of the state, from which they
</p>
<p>
 fled, be delivered up; and that full faith and credit should be given, in
each of the states, to the records, acts, and judicial proceedings of the
courts and magistrates of every other state.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 231.
 </b>
 Having thus provided for the security and intercourse
of the
states, the next article (5th) provided for the organization of a general
congress, declaring, that delegates should be chosen in such manner, as the
legislature of each state should direct; to meet in congress on the first
Monday in every year, with a power, reserved to each state, to recall any
or all of the delegates, and to send others in their stead.  No state was
to be represented in congress by less than two, nor more than seven
members.  No delegate was eligible for more than three, in any term of six
years; and no delegate was capable of holding any office of emolument under
the United States.  Each state was to maintain its own delegates; and, in
determining questions in congress, was to have one vote.  Freedom of speech
and debate in congress was not to be impeached or questioned in any other
place; and the members were to be protected from arrest and imprisonment,
during the time of their going to and from, and attendance on congress,
except for treason, felony, or breach of the peace.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 232.
 </b>
 By subsequent articles, congress was invested with the
sole and
exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war, unless in case
of an invasion of a state by enemies, or an imminent danger of an invasion
by Indians; of sending and receiving ambassadors; entering into treaties
and alliances, under certain limitations, as to treaties of commerce;

 of
es-
</p>
<p>
 tablishing rules for deciding all cases of capture on land and water, and
for the division and appropriation of prizes taken by the land or naval
forces, in the service of the United States; of granting letters of marque
and reprisal in times of peace; of appointing courts for the trial of
piracies and felonies committed on the high seas; and of establishing
courts for receiving and finally determining appeals in all cases of
captures.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 233.
 </b>
 Congress was also invested with power to decide in the last
resort, on appeal, all disputes and differences between two or more states
concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatsoever; and the
mode of exercising that authority was specially prescribed.  And all
controversies concerning the private right of soil, claimed under different
grants of two or more states before the settlement of their jurisdiction,
were to be finally determined in the same manner, upon the petition of
either of the grantees.  But no state was to be deprived of territory for
the benefit of the United States.
</p>
<p>
 § 234.  Congress was also invested with the sole and
exclusive right and po
wer of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own
authority, or that of the United States; of fixing the standard of weights
and measures throughout the United States; of regulating the trade and
managing all affairs with the Indians, not members of any of the states,
provided, that the legislative right of any state within its own limits
should be not infringed or violated; of establishing and regulating
post-offices from one state to another, and exacting postage to defray the
expenses; of appointing all
</p>
<p>
 officers of the land forces in the service of the United States, except
regimental officers; of appointing all officers of the naval forces, and
commissioning all officers whatsoever in the service of the United States;
and of making rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval
forces, and directing their operations.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 235.
 </b>
 Congress was also invested with authority to appoint a
committee
of the states to sit in the recess of congress, and to consist of one
delegate from each state, and other committees and civil officers, to
manage the general affairs under their direction; to appoint one of their
number to preside, but no person was to serve in the office of president
more than one year in the term of three years; to ascertain the necessary
sums for the public service, and to appropriate the same for defraying the
public expenses; to barrow money, and emit bills on credit of the United
States; to build and equip a navy; to agree upon the number of land forces,
and make requisitions upon each state for its quota, in proportion to the
number of white inhabitants in such state.  The legislature of each state
were to appoint the regimental officers, raise the men, and clothe, arm,
and equip them at the expense of the United States.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 236.
 </b>
 Congress was also invested with power to adjourn for
any time not
exceeding six months, and to any place within the United States; and
provision was made for the publication of its journal, and for entering the
yeas and nays thereon, when desired by any delegate.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 237.
 </b>
 Such were the powers confided in congress.  But even
these were
greatly restricted in their exercise; for it was expressly provided, that
congress should never engage in a war; nor grant letters of marque or
</p>
<p>
 reprisal in time of peace; nor enter into any treaties or alliances; nor
coin money, or regulate the value thereof; nor ascertain the sums or
expenses necessary for the defence and welfare of the United States; nor
emit bills; nor borrow money on the credit of the United States; nor
appropriate money; nor agree upon the number of vessels of war to be built,
or purchased; or the number of land or sea forces to be raised; nor appoint
a commander in chief of the army or navy; unless nine states should assent
to the same.  And no question on any other point, except for adjourning
from day to day, was to be determined, except by the vote of a majority of
the states.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 238.
 </b>
 The committee of the states, or any nine of them, were
authorized
in the recess of congress to exercise such powers, as congress, with the
assent of nine states, should think it expedient to vest them with, except
such powers, for the exercise of which, by the articles of confederation,
the assent of nine states was required, which could not be thus delegated.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 239.
 </b>
 It was further provided, that all bills of credit, monies
borrowed, and debts contracted by or under the authority of congress before
the confederation, should be a charge against the United States; that when
land forces were raised by any state for the common defence, all officers
of or under the rank of colonel should be appointed by the legislature of
the state, or in such manner, as the state should direct; and all vacancies
should be filled up in the same manner; that all charges of war, and all
other expenses for the common defence or general welfare, should be
defrayed out of a common treasury, which should be supplied by the several
states, in proportion to the value of the land within each state granted or
surveyed, and the buildings and im-
</p>
<p>
 provements thereon, to be estimated according to the mode prescribed by
congress; and the taxes for that proportion were to be laid and levied by
the legislatures of the states within the time agreed upon by congress.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 240.
 </b>
 Certain prohibitions were laid upon the exercise of
powers by the
respective states.  No state, without the consent of the United States,
could send an embassy to? or receive an embassy from, or enter into, any
treaty with any king, prince, or state; nor could any person holding any
office under the United States, or any of them, accept any present,
emolument, office, or title, from any foreign king, prince, or state; nor
could congress itself grant any title of nobility.  No two states could
enter into any treaty, confederation, or alliance with each other, without
the consent of congress.  No state could lay any imports or duties, which
might interfere with any then proposed treaties.  No vessels of war were to
be kept up by any state in time of peace, except deemed necessary by
congress for its defence, or trade, nor any body of forces, except such, as
should be deemed requisite by congress to garrison its forts, and necessary
for its defence.  But every state was required always to keep up a well
regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutred, and to
be provided with suitable field-pieces, and tents, and arms, and
ammunition, and camp-equipage.  No state could engage in war without the
consent of congress, unless actually invaded by enemies, or in danger of
invasion by the Indians.  Nor could any state grant commissions to any
ships of war, nor letters of marque and reprisal, except after a
declaration of war by congress, unless such state were infested by pirates,
and
</p>
<p>
 then subject to the determination of congress.  No state could prevent the
removal of any property imported into any state to any other state, of
which the owner was an inhabitant.  And no imposition, duties, or
restriction could be laid by any state on the property of the United States
or of either of them.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 241.
 </b>
 There was also provision made for the admission of
Canada into the
union, and of other colonies with the assent of nine states.  And it was
finally declared, that every state should abide by the determinations of
congress on all questions submitted to it by the confederation; that the
articles should be inviolably observed by every state; that the union
should be perpetual; and that no alterations should be made in any of the
articles, unless agreed to by congress, and confirmed by the legislatures
of every state.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 242.
 </b>
 Such is the substance of this celebrated instrument,
under which
the treaty of peace, acknowledging our independence, was negotiated, the
war of the revolution concluded, and the union of the states maintained
until the adoption of the present constitution.
