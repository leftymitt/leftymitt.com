§ 306.
</b>
{279}Having thus sketched out a general history of the
origin and adoption of the constitution of the United States, and a summary of
the principal objections and difficulties, which it had to encounter, we are at
length arrived at the point at which it may be proper to enter upon the
consideration of the actual structure, organization, and powers, which belong
to it. Our main object will henceforth be to unfold in detail all its principal
provisions, with such commentaries, as may explain their import and effect, and
with such illustrations, historical and otherwise, as will enable the reader
fully to understand the objections, which have been urged against each of them
respectively; the amendments, which have been proposed to them; and the
arguments, which have sustained them in their present form.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 307.
</b>
Before doing this, however, it seems necessary, in the
first place , to bestow some attention upon several points, which have
attracted a good deal ofdiscussion, and which are preliminary in their own
nature; and in the next place to consider, what are the true rules of
interpretation belonging to the instrument.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 308.
</b>
In the first place, what is the true nature and import
of the instrument? Is it a treaty, a convention, a league, a contract, or a
compact? Who are the parties to it? By whom was it made? By whom was it
ratified? What are its obligations? By {280} whom, and in what manner may it be
dissolved? Who are to determine its validity and construction? Who are to
decide upon the supposed infractions and violations of it? These are questions
often asked, and often discussed, not merely for the purpose of theoretical
speculation; but as matters of practical importance, and of earnest and even of
vehement debate. The answers given to them by statesmen and jurists are often
contradictory, and irreconcilable with each other; and the consequences,
deduced from the views taken of some of them, go very deep into the foundations
of the government itself, and expose it, if not to utter destruction, at least
to evils, which threaten its existence, and disturb the just operation of its
powers.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 309.
</b>
It will be our object to present in a condensed form,
some of the principal expositions, which have been insisted on at different
times, as to the nature and obligations of the constitution, and to offer some
of the principal objections, which have been suggested against those
expositions. To attempt a minute enumeration would, indeed, be an impracticable
task; and considering the delicate nature of others, which are still the
subject of heated controversy, where the ashes are scarcely yet cold, which
cover the concealed fires of former political excitements, it is sufficiently
difficult to detach some of the more important from the mass of accidental
matter, in which they are involved.
</p>


<p>
<b>
§ 310.
</b>
It has been asserted by a learned
commentator,
<sup>
<b>
[1]
</b>
</sup>
that the constitution of the United States is
an original, written, federal, and social compact, freely, voluntarily, and
solemnly entered into by the several {281} states, and ratified by the people
thereof respectively; whereby the several states, and the people thereof,
respectively have bound themselves to each other, and to the federal government
of the United States, and by which the federal government is bound to the
several states and to every citizen of. the United States. The author proceeds
to expound every part of this definition at large. It is (says he) a compact,
by which it is distinguished from a charter or grant, which is either the act
of a superior to an inferior, or is founded upon some consideration moving from
one of the parties to the other, and operates as an exchange or
sale.
<sup>
<b>
[2]
</b>
</sup>
But were the contracting parties, whether considered
as states in their political capacity and character, or as individuals, are all
equal; nor is there any thing granted from one to another; but each stipulates
to part with, and receive the same thing precisely without any distinction or
difference between any of the parties.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 311.
</b>
It is a federal compact.
<sup>
<b>
[3]
</b>
</sup>
Several
sovereign and independent states may unite themselves together by a perpetual
confederation, without each ceasing to be a perfect state. They will together
form a federal republic. The deliberations in common will offer no {282}
violence to each member, though they may in certain respects put some
constraint on the exercise of it in virtue of voluntary engagements. The
extent, modifications, and objects of the federal authority are mere matters of
discretion.
<sup>
<b>
[4]
</b>
</sup>
So long, as the separate organization of the
members remains; and, from the nature of the compact, must continue to exist
both for local and domestic, and for federal purposes, the union is in fact, as
well as in theory, an association of states, or a confederacy.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 312.
</b>
It is, also, to a certain extent, a social compact. In
the act of association, in virtue of which a multitude of men form together a
state or nation, each individual is supposed to have entered into engagements
with all, to procure the common welfare; and all are supposed to have entered
into engagements with each other, to facilitate the means of supplying the
necessities of each individual, and to protect and defend
him.
<sup>
<b>
[5]
</b>
</sup>
And this is what is ordinarily meant by the original
contract of society. But a contract of this nature actually existed in a
visible form between the citizens of each state in their several constitutions.
It might, therefore, be deemed somewhat extraordinary, that in the
establishment of a federal republic, it should have been thought necessary to
extend its operation to the persons of individuals, as well as to the states
composing the confederacy.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 313.
</b>
It may be proper to illustrate the distinction between
federal compacts and obligations, and such as are social, by one or two
examples.
<sup>
<b>
[6]
</b>
</sup>
A federal compact, alliance, or treaty, is an
act of the state or body politic, and not of an individual. On the contrary, a
{283} social compact is understood to mean the act of individuals about to
create, and establish a state or body politic among, themselves. If one nation
binds itself by treaty to pay a certain tribute to another; or if all the
members of the same confederacy oblige themselves to furnish their quo[as of a
common expense, when required; in either of these cases, the state or body
politic only, and not the individual, is answerable for this tribute or quota.
This is, therefore, a federal obligation. But, where by any compact, express or
implied, a number of persons are bound to contribute their proportions of the
common expenses, or to submit to all laws made by the common consent; and where
in default of compliance with these engagements the society is authorized to
levy the contribution, or to punish the person of the delinquent; this seems to
be understood to be more in the nature of a social, than a federal
obligation.
<sup>
<b>
[7]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 314.
</b>
It is an original compact. Whatever political relation
existed between the American colonies antecedent to the Revolution, as
constituent parts of the British empire, or as dependencies upon it, that
relation was completely dissolved, and annihilated from that period. From the
moment of the Revolution they became severally independent and sovereign
slates, possessing all the lights, jurisdictions, and authority, that other
sovereign states, however constituted, or by whatever title denominated,
possess; and bound by no ties, but of their own creation, except such, as all
other civilized nations are equally bound by, and which together constitute the
customary law of nations.
<sup>
<b>
[8]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 315.
</b>
{284} It is a written compact. Considered as a federal
compact or alliance between the states, there is nothing new or singular in
this circumstance, as all national compacts since the invention of letters have
probably been reduced to that form. But considered in the light of an original
social compact, the American Revolution seems to have given birth to this new
political phenomenon. In every state a written constitution was framed, and
adopted by the people both in their individual and sovereign capacity and
character.
<sup>
<b>
[9]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 316.
</b>
{285} It is a compact freely, voluntarily, and solemnly
entered into by the several states, and ratified by the people thereof
respectively; freely, there being neither external nor internal force or
violence to influence, or promote the measure; the United States being at peace
with all the world and in perfect tranquility in each state; voluntarily,
because the measure had its commencement in the spontaneous acts of the state
legislatures, prompted by a due sense of the necessity of some change in the
existing confederation; and solemnly, as having been discussed, not only in the
general convention, which proposed and framed it; but afterwards in the
legislatures of the several states; and finally in the conventions of all the
states, by whom it was adopted and ratified.
<sup>
<b>
[10]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 317.
</b>
It is a compact, by which the several states and the
people thereof respectively have bound themselves to each other, and to the
federal government. The constitution had its commencement with the body politic
of the several states; and its final adoption and ratification was by the
several legislatures referred to, and completed by conventions especially,
called and appointed for that purpose in each state. The acceptance of the
constitution was not only an act of the body politic of each state, but of the
people thereof respectively in their sovereign character and capacity. The body
politic was competent to bind itself, so far as the constitution of the state
permitted.
<sup>
<b>
[11]
</b>
</sup>
But not having power to bind the people in
cases beyond their constitutional authority, the assent of the people was
indispensably necessary to the validity of the compact, {286} by which the
rights of the people might be diminished, or submitted to a new jurisdiction,
or in any manner affected. From hence, not only the body politic of the several
states, but every citizen thereof, may be considered as parties to the compact,
and to have bound themselves reciprocally to each other for the due observance
of it; and also to have bound themselves to the federal government, whose
authority has been thereby created and established.
<sup>
<b>
[12]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 318.
</b>
Lastly. It is a compact, by which the federal government
is bound to the several states, and to every citizen of the United States.
Although the federal government can in no possible view be considered as a
party to a compact made anterior to its existence, and by which it was in fact
created; yet, as the creature of that compact, it must be bound by it to its
creators, the several states in the union, and the citizens thereof. Having no
existence, but under the constitution, nor any rights, but such as that
instrument confers; and those very rights being, in fact duties, it can possess
no legitimate power, but such as is absolutely necessary for the performance of
a duty prescribed, and enjoined by the constitution.
<sup>
<b>
[13]
</b>
</sup>
Its
duties then became the exact measure of its powers; and whenever it exerts a
power for any other purpose, than the performance of a duty prescribed by the
constitution, it transgresses its proper limits, and violates the public trust.
Its duties being moreover imposed for the general benefit and security of the
several states in their political character, and of the people, both in their
sovereign and individual capacity, if these objects be not obtained, the
government does not answer the end of its creation. It is, {287} therefore,
bound to the several states respectively, and to every citizen thereof, for the
due execution of those duties, and the observance of this obligation is
enforced under the solemn sanction of an oath from those, who administer the
government.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 319.
</b>
Such is a summary of the reasoning of the learned
author, by which he has undertaken to vindicate his views of the nature of the
constitution. That reasoning s been quoted at large, and for the most part in
his own words; not merely as his own, but as representing, in a general sense,
the opinions of a large body of statesmen and jurists in different parts of the
Union, avowed and acted upon in former times; and recently revived under
circumstances, which have given them increased importance, if not a perilous
influence.
<sup>
<b>
[14]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 320.
</b>
It is wholly beside our present purpose to engage in a
critical commentary upon the different parts of this exposition. It will be
sufficient for all the practical objects we have in view, to suggest the
difficulties of maintaining its leading positions, to expound the objections,
which have been urged against them, and to bring into notice those opinions,
which rest on a very different basis of principles.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 321.
</b>
The obvious deductions, which may be, and indeed have
been, drawn from considering the constitution as a compact between the states,
are, that it {288} operates as a mere treaty, or convention between them, and
has an obligatory force upon each state no longer, than suits its pleasure, or
its consent continues; that each state has a right to judge for itself in
relation to the nature extent, and obligations. Of the instrument, without
being at all bound by the interpretation of the federal government, or by that
of any other state; and that each retains the power to withdraw from the
confederacy and to dissolve the connexion, when such shall be its choice; and
may suspend the operations of the federal government, and nullify its acts
within its own territorial limits, whenever, in its own opinion, the {289}
exigency of the case may require.
<sup>
<b>
[15]
</b>
</sup>
These conclusions may
not always be avowed; but they flow naturally from the doctrines, which we have
under consideration.
<sup>
<b>
[16]
</b>
</sup>
They go to the extent of reducing
the government to a mere confederacy during pleasure; and of thus presenting
the extraordinary spectacle of a nation existing only at the will of each of
its constituent parts.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 322.
</b>
{290} If this be the true interpretation of the
instrument, it has wholl y railed to express the intentions of its framers, and
brings back, or at least may bring back, upon us all the evils of the old
confederation, from which we were supposed to have had a safe deliverence. For
the power to operate upon individuals, instead of operating merely on states,
is of little consequence, though yielded by the constitution, if that power is
to depend for, its exercise upon the continual consent of all the members upon
every emergency. We have already seen, that the framers of the instrument
contemplated no such dependence. Even under the confederation it was deemed a
gross heresy to maintain, that a party to a compact has a right to revoke that
compact; and the possibility of a question of this nature was deemed to prove
the necessity of laying the foundations of our national government deeper, than
in the mere sanction of delegated authority.
<sup>
<b>
[17]
</b>
</sup>
"A
compact between independent sovereigns, founded on acts of legislative
authority, can pretend to no higher validity, than a league or treaty between
the parties. It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all
the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one
article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach committed by either
of the parties absolves the others, and authorizes them, if they please, to
pronounce the compact violated and void."
<sup>
<b>
[18]
</b>
</sup>
Consequences like these, which place the dissolution {291} of the government in
the hands of a single state, and enable it at will to defeat, or suspend the
operation of the laws of the union, are too serious, not to require us to
scrutinize with the utmost care and caution the principles, from which they
flow, and by which they are attempted to be justified.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 323.
</b>
The word " compact," like many other important
words in our language, is susceptible of different shades of meaning, and may
be used in different senses. It is sometimes used merely to express a
deliberate and voluntary assent to any act or thing. Thus, it has been said by
Dr. South, that " in the beginnings of speech, there was an implicit
compact founded upon common consent, that such words, voices, or gestures,
should be signs, whereby they would express their
thoughts;"
<sup>
<b>
[19]
</b>
</sup>
where, it is obvious, that nothing more
is meant, than a mutual and settled appointment in the use of language. It is
also used to express any agreement or contract between parties, by which they
are bound, and incur legal obligations.
<sup>
<b>
[20]
</b>
</sup>
Thus we say, that
one person has entered into a compact with another, meaning, that the
contracting parties have entered {292} into some agreement, which is valid in
point of law, and includes mutual rights and obligations between them. And it
is also used, in an emphatic sense, to denote those agreements and
stipulations, which are entered into between nations, such as public treaties,
conventions, confederacies, and other solemn acts of national
authority.
<sup>
<b>
[21]
</b>
</sup>
When we speak of a compact in a legal sense,
we naturally include in it the notion of distinct contracting parties, having
mutual rights, and remedies to enforce the obligations arising therefrom. We
suppose, that each party has an equal and independent capacity to enter into
the contract, and has an equal right to judge of its terms, to enforce its
obligations, and to insist upon redress for any violation of
them.
<sup>
<b>
[22]
</b>
</sup>
This, in a general sense, is true under our systems
of municipal law, though practically, that law stops short of maintaining it in
all the variety of forms, to which modern refinement has pushed the doctrine of
implied contracts.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 324.
</b>
A compact may, then, be said in its most general sense
to import an agreement according to Lord Coke's definition, aggregatio mentium,
an aggregation or consent of minds; in its stricter sense to import a contract
between parties, which creates obligations, and rights capable of being
enforced, and contemplated, as such, by the parties, in their distinct and
independent characters. This is equally true of them; whether the contract be
between individuals, or between nations. The remedies are, or may be,
different; but the right to enforce, as accessory to the obligation, is equally
retained in each case. It forms the very substratum of the engagement.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 325.
</b>
{293} The doctrine maintained by many eminent writers
upon public law in modern times is, that civil society has its foundation in a
voluntary consent or submission;
<sup>
<b>
[23]
</b>
</sup>
and, therefore, it is
often said to depend upon a social compact of the people composing the nation.
And this, indeed, does not, in substance, differ from the definition of it by
Cicero, Multitudo, juris consensu et utilitatis communione sociata; that is,
(as Burlamaqui gives it,) a multitude of people united together by a common
interest, and by common laws, to which they submit with one
accord.
<sup>
<b>
[24]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 326.
</b>
{294} Mr. Justice Blackstone has very justly observed,
that the theory of an original contract upon the first formation of society is
a visionary notion. "But though society had not its formal beginning from
any convention of individuals actuated by their wants and fears; yet it is the
sense of their weakness and imperfection, that keeps mankind together; that
demonstrates the necessity of this union; and that, therefore, is the solid and
natural foundation, as well {295} as the cement of civil society. And this is
what we mean by the original contract of society; which, though perhaps in no
instance it has ever been formally expressed at the first institution of a
state, yet, in nature and reason, must always be understood, and implied in the
very act of associating together; namely, that the whole should protect all its
parts, and that every part should pay obedience to the will of the whole; or,
in other words, that the community should guard the rights of each individual
member; and that in return for this protection each individual should submit to
the laws of the community."
<sup>
<b>
[25]
</b>
</sup>
It is in this sense,
that the preamble of the constitution of Massachusetts asserts, that "the
body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals; that it is a
social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen and each
citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for
the common good;" and that in the same preamble, the people acknowledge
with grateful hearts, that Providence had afforded them an opportunity "of
entering into an original, explicit, and solemn compact with each other, and of
forming a new constitution of civil government for themselves and their
posterity." It is in this sense too, that Mr. Chief Justice Jay is to be
understood, when he asserts,
<sup>
<b>
[26]
</b>
</sup>
that "every state
constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a state to govern
themselves in a certain manner; and the constitution of the United States is,
likewise, a compact {296} made by the people of the United States, to govern
themselves as to general objects in a certain manner." He had immediately
before stated, with reference to the preamble of the constitution, "Mere
we see the people acting, as sovereigns of the whole country; and in the
language of sovereignty, establishing a constitution, by which it was their
will, that the state governments should be bound, and to which the state
constitutions should be made to conform."
<sup>
<b>
[27]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 327.
</b>
But although in a general sense, and theoretically
speaking, the formation of civil societies and states may thus be said to be
founded in a social compact or contract, that is, in the solemn, express or
implied consent of the individuals composing them; yet the doctrine itself
requires many limitations and qualifications, when applied to the actual
condition of nations, even of those, which are most free in their
organization.
<sup>
<b>
[28]
</b>
</sup>
Every state, however organized, embraces
many persons in it, who have never assented to its form of government; and
many, who are deemed incapable of such assent, and yet who are held bound by
its fundamental institutions and laws. Infants, minors, married women, persons
insane, and many others, are deemed subjects of a country, and bound by its
laws; although they have {297} never assented thereto, and may by those very
laws be disabled from such an act. Even our most solemn instruments of
government, framed and adopted as the constitutions of our state governments,
are not only not founded upon the assent of all the people within the
territorial jurisdiction; but that assent is expressly excluded by the very
manner, in which the ratification is required to be made. That ratification is
restricted to those, who are qualified voters; and who are, or shall be
qualified voters, is decided by the majority in the convention or other body,
which submits the constitution to the people. All of the American constitutions
have been formed in this manner. The assent of minors, of women, and of
unqualified voters has never been asked or allowed; yet these embrace a
majority of the whole population in every organized society, and are governed
by its existing institutions. Nay more; a majority only of the qualified voters
is deemed sufficient to change the fundamental institutions of the state, upon
the general principle, that the majority has at all times a right to govern the
minority, and to bind the latter to obedience to the will of the former. And if
more than a plurality is, in any case, required, to amend or change the actual
constitution of the society, it is a matter of political choice with the
majority for the time being, and not of right on the part of the minority.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 328.
</b>
It is a matter of fact, therefore, in the history of our
own forms of government, that they have been formed without the consent,
express or implied, of the whole people; and that, although firmly established,
they owe their existence and authority to the simple will of the majority of
the qualified voters. There is not probably a single state in the Union, whose
constitution has not been adopted against the opinions and wishes of {298} a
large minority, even of the qualified voters; and it is notorious, that some of
them have been adopted by a small majority of votes. How, then, can we assert
with truth, that even in our free constitutions the government is founded in
fact on the assent of the whole people, when many of them have not been
permitted to express any opinion, and many have expressed a decided dissent? In
what manner are we to prove, that every citizen of the state has contracted
with all the other citizens, that such constitution shall be a binding compact
between them, with mutual obligations to observe and keep it, against such
positive dissent? If it be said, that by entering into. the society an assent
is necessarily implied to submit to the majority, how is it proved, that a
majority of all the people of all ages and sexes were ever asked to assent, or
did assent to such a proposition? And as to persons subsequently born, and
subjected by birth to such society, where is the record of such assent in point
of law or fact?
<sup>
<b>
[29]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 329.
</b>
In respect to the American revolution itself, it is
notorious, that was brought about against the wishes and resistance of a
formidable minority of the people; and that the declaration of independence
never had the universal assent of all the inhabitants of the country. So, that
this great and glorious change in the organization of our government owes its
whole authority to the efforts of a triumphant majority. And the dissent on the
part of the minority was deemed in many cases a crime, carrying along with it
the penalty of confiscation, forfeiture, and personal, and even capital
punishment; and in its mildest form was deemed an unwarrantable outrage upon
the public rights, and a total disregard of the duties of patriotism.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 330.
</b>
{299} The truth is, that the majority of every organized
society has always claimed, and exercised the right to govern the whole of that
society, in the manner pointed out by the fundamental laws, which from time to
time have existed in such society.
<sup>
<b>
[30]
</b>
</sup>
Every revolution, at
least when not produced by positive force, has been founded upon the authority
of such majority. And the right results from the very necessities of our
nature; for universal consent can never be practically required or obtained.
The minority are bound, whether they have assented or not; for the plain
reason, that opposite wills in the same society, on the same subjects, cannot
prevail at the same time; and, as society is instituted for the general safety
and happiness, in a conflict of opinion the majority must have a right to
accomplish that object by the means, which they deem adequate for the end. The
majority may, indeed, decide, how far they will respect the rights or claims of
the minority; and how far they will, from policy or principle, insist upon or
absolve them from obedience. But this is a matter, on which it decides for
itself, according to its own notions of justice or convenience. In a general
sense the will of the majority of the people is absolute and sovereign, limited
only by its means and power to make its will effectual.
<sup>
<b>
[31]
</b>
</sup>
The declaration of independence (which, it is historically known, was not the
act of the whole American people) puts the {300} doctrine on its true grounds;
Men are endowed, it declares, with certain unalienable rights, and among these
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
these ends, it is the right of the people (plainly intending, the majority of
the people) to alter, or to abolish it, and to institute a new government,
laying its foundationon such principles, and organizing its powers in such
forms, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 331.
</b>
But whatever may be the true doctrine, as to the nature
of the original compact of society, or of the subsequent institution and
organization of governments consequent thereon, it is a very unjustifiable
course of reasoning to connect with the theory all the ordinary doctrines
applicable to municipal contracts between individuals, or to public conventions
between nations. We have already seen, that the theory itself is subject to
many qualifications; but whether true or not, it is impossible, with a just
regard to the objects and interests of society, or the nature of compacts of
government, to subject them to the same constructions and conditions, as belong
to positive obligations, created between independent parties, contemplating, a
distinct and personal responsibility. One of the first elementary principles of
all contracts is, to interpret them according, to the intentions and objects of
the parties. they are not to be so construed, as to subvert the obvious
objects, for which they were made; or to lead to results wholly beside the
apparent intentions of those, who framed them.
<sup>
<b>
[32]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 332.
</b>
{301} Admitting, therefore, for the sake of argument,
that the institution of a government is to be deemed, in the restricted sense
already suggested, an original compact or contract between each citizen and the
whole community, is it to be construed, as a continuing contract after its
adoption, so as to involve the notion of there being still distinct and
independent parties to the instrument, capable, and entitled, as matter of
right, to judge and act upon its construction, according, to their own views of
its import and obligations? to resist the enforcement of the powers delegated
to the government at the good pleasure of each? to dissolve all connexion with
it, whenever there is a supposed breach of it on the other
side?
<sup>
<b>
[33]
</b>
</sup>
These are momentous questions, and go to the very
foundation of every government founded on the voluntary choice of the people;
and they should be seriously investigated, before we admit the conclusions,
which may be drawn from one aspect of them.
<sup>
<b>
[34]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 333.
</b>
{302} Take, for instance, the constitution of
Massachusetts, which in its preamble contains the declaration already quoted,
that government "is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants
with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole government;" are we to
construe that compact, after the adoption of the constitution, as still a
contract, in which each citizen is still a distinct party, entitled to his
remedy for any breach of its obligations, and authorized to separate himself
from the whole society, and to throw off all allegiance, whenever he supposes,
that any of the fundamental principles of that compact are infringed, or
misconstrued? Did the people intend, that it should be thus in the power of any
individual to dissolve the whole government at his pleasure, or to absolve
himself from all obligations and duties thereto, at his choice, or upon his own
interpretation of the instrument? If such a power exists, where is the
permanence or security of the government? In what manner are the rights and
property of the citizens to be maintained or enforced? Where are the duties of
allegiance or obedience? May one withdraw his consent to-day, and re-assert it
to-morrow? May one claim the protection and assistance of the laws and
institutions to-day, and to-morrow repudiate them? May one declare war against
all the others for a supposed {303} infringement of the constitution? If he
may, then each one has the same right in relation to all others; and anarchy
and confusion, and not order and good government and obedience, are the
ingredients, which are mainly at work in all free institutions, founded upon
the will, and choice, and compact of the people. The existence of the
government, and its peace, and its vital interests will, under such
circumstances, be at the mercy and even at the caprice of a single individual.
It would not only be vain, but unjust to punish him for disturbing society,
when it is but by a just exercise of the original rights reserved to him by the
compact. The maxim, that in every government the will of the majority shall,
and ought to govern the rest, would be thus subverted; and society would, in
effect, be reduced to its original elements. The association would be temporary
and fugitive, like those voluntary meetings among barbarous and savage
communities, where each acts for himself, and submits only, while it is his
pleasure.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 334.
</b>
It can readily be understood, in what manner contracts,
entered into by private persons, are to be construed, and enforced under the
regular operations of an organized government. Under such circumstances, if a
breach is insisted on by either side, the proper redress is administered by the
sovereign power, through the medium of its delegated functionaries, and usually
by the judicial department, according to the principles established by the
laws, which compose the jurisprudence of that country. In such a case no person
supposes, that each party is at liberty to insist absolutely and positively
upon his own construction, and to redress himself accordingly by force or by
fraud. He is compellable to submit the decision to others, not chosen by
himself, but appointed by the government, to secure {304} the rights, and
redress the wrongs of the whole community. In such cases the doctrine prevails,
inter leges silent arma. But the reverse maxim would prevail upon the doctrine,
of which we are speaking,
<i>
inter arma silent leges
</i>
. It is plain, that
such a resort is not contemplated by any of our forms of government, by a suit
of one citizen against the whole for a redress of his grievances, or for a
specific performance of the obligations of the constitution. He may have, and
doubtless in our forms of administering justice has, a complete protection of
his rights secured by the constitution, when they are invaded by any other
citizen. But that is in a suit by one citizen against another; and not against
the body politic, upon the notion of contract.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 335.
</b>
It is easy, also, to understand, how compacts between
independent nations are to be construed, and violations of them redressed.
Nations, in their sovereign character, are all upon an equality; and do not
acknowledge any superior, by whose decrees they are bound, or to whose opinions
they are obedient. Whenever, therefore, any differences arise between them, as
to the interpretation of a treaty, or of the breach of its terms, there is no
common arbiter, whom they are bound to acknowledge, having authority to decide
them. There are but three modes, in which these differences can be adjusted;
first, by new negotiations, embracing and settling the matters in dispute;
secondly, by referring the same to some common arbitor, pro hac vice, whom they
invest with such power; or thirdly, by a resort to arms, which is the
<i>
ultima
ratio regum
</i>
, or the last appeal between sovereigns.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 336.
</b>
It seems equally plain, that in our forms of government,
the constitution cannot contemplate either of these modes of interpretation or
redress. Each {305} citizen is not supposed to enter into the compact, as a
sovereign with all the others as sovereign, retaining an independent and
coequal authority to Judge, and decide for himself. He has no authority
reserved to institute new negotiations; or to suspend the operations of the
constitution, or to compel the reference to a common arbiter; or to declare war
against the community, to which he belongs.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 337.
</b>
No such claim has ever (at least to our knowledge) been
asserted by any jurist or statesman, in respect to any of our state
constitutions. The understanding is general, if not universal, that, having
been adopted by the majority of the people, the constitution of the state binds
the whole community proprio vigore; and is unalterable, unless by the consent
of the majority of the people, or at least of the qualified voters of the
state, in the manner prescribed by the constitution, or otherwise provided for
by the majority. No right exists, or is supposed to exist, on the part of any
town, or county, or other organized body within the state, short of a majority
of the whole people of the state, to alter, suspend, resist, or dissolve the
operations of that constitution, or to withdraw themselves from its
jurisdiction. Much less is the compact supposed liable to interruption, or
suspension, or dissolution, at the will of any private citizen upon his own
notion of its obligations, or of any infringements of them by the constituted
authorities.
<sup>
<b>
[35]
</b>
</sup>
The only redress for any such infringements,
and the only guaranty of individual rights and property, are understood to
consist in the peaceable appeal to the proper tribunals constituted by the
government for such {306} purposes; or if these should fail, by the ultimate
appeal to the good sense, and integrity, and justice of the majority of the
people. And this, according to Mr. Locke, is the true sense of the original
compact, by which every individual has surrendered to the majority of the
society the right permanently to control, and direct the operations of
government therein.
<sup>
<b>
[36]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 338.
</b>
The true view to be taken of our state constitutions is,
that they are forms of government, ordained and established by the people in
their original sovereign capacity to promote their own happiness, and
permanently to secure their rights, property, independence, and common welfare.
The language of nearly all these state constitutions is, that the people do
ordain and establish this constitution; and where these terms are not expressly
used, they are necessarily implied in the very substance of the frame of
government.
<sup>
<b>
[37]
</b>
</sup>
They may be deemed compacts, (though not
generally declared so on their face,) in the sense of their being founded on
the voluntary consent or agreement of a majority of the qualified voters of the
state. But they are not treated as contracts and conventions between
independent individuals and communities, having no common
umpire.
<sup>
<b>
[38]
</b>
</sup>
The language of these instruments is not the
usual or appropriate language for mere matters resting, and forever to rest in
{307} contract. In general the import is, that the people "ordain and
establish," that is, in their sovereign capacity, meet and declare, what
shall be the fundamental LAW for the government of themselves and their
posterity. Even in the constitution of Massachusetts, which, more than any
other, wears the air of contract, the compact is declared to be a "mere
constitution of civil government," and the people "do agree on,
ordain, and establish the following declaration of rights, and frame of
government, as the constitution of government." In this very bill of
rights, the people are declared " to have the sole and exclusive right of
governing themselves, as a free, sovereign, and independent state"; and
that "they have an incontestible, unalienable, and indefeasible right to
institute government, and to reform, alter, or totally change the same, when
their protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness require it." It is,
and accordingly has always been, treated as a fundamental law, and not as a
mere contract of government, during the good pleasure of all the persons; who
were originally bound by it, or assented to it.
<sup>
<b>
[39]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 339.
</b>
A constitution is in fact a fundamental law or basis of
government, and falls strictly within the definition of law, as given by Mr.
Justice Blackstone. It is a {308} rule of action, prescribed by the supreme
power in a state, regulating the rights and duties of the whole community. It
is a rule, as contradistinguished from a temporary or sudden order; permanent,
uniform, and universal. It is also called a rule, to distinguish it from a
compact, or agreement; for a compact (he adds) is a promise. proceeding from
us; law is a command directed to us. The language of a compact is, I will, or
will not do this; that of a law is, Thou shalt, or shalt not do
it.
<sup>
<b>
[40]
</b>
</sup>
"In compacts we ourselves determine and promise,
what shall be done, before we are obliged to do it. In laws, we are obliged to
act without ourselves determining, or promising any thing at
all."
<sup>
<b>
[41]
</b>
</sup>
It is a rule prescribed; that is, it is laid
down, promulgated, and established. It is prescribed by the supreme power in a
state, that is, among us, by the people, or a majorityof them in their original
sovereign capacity. Like the ordinary municipal laws, it may be founded upon
our consent, or that of our representatives; but it derives its ultimate
obligatory force, as a law, and not as a compact.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 340.
</b>
And it is in this light, that the language of the
constitution of the United States manifestly contemplates it; for it declares
(article 6th), that this constitution and the laws, &amp;c. and treaties made
under the authority of the United States, "shall be the supreme LAW of the
land." This (as has been justly observed by the Federalist) results from
the very nature of political institutions. A law, by the very meaning of the
terms, includes supremacy.
<sup>
<b>
[42]
</b>
</sup>
If individuals enter into
{309}
</p>
<p>
a state of society, the laws of that society must be the supreme regulator
of their conduct. If a number of political societies enter into a larger
political society, the laws, which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers
entrusted to it by its constitution, must be supreme over those societies, and
the individuals, of whom they are composed. It would otherwise be a mere
treaty, dependent on the good faith of the parties, and not a government, which
is only another word for political power and supremacy.
<sup>
<b>
[43]
</b>
</sup>
A
state constitution is then in a just and appropriate sense, not only a law, but
a supreme law, for the government of the whole people, within the range of the
powers actually contemplated, and the rights secured by it. It would, indeed,
be an extraordinary use of language to consider a declaration of rights in a
constitution, and especially of rights, which it proclaims to be
"unalienable and indefeasible," to be a matter of contract, and
resting, on such a basis, rather than a solemn recognition and admission of
those rights, arising from the law of nature, and the gift of Providence, and
incapable of being, transferred or surrendered.

<b>
§ 341.
</b>
{310} The resolution of the convention of the peers and
commons in 1688 which deprived King James the Second of the throne of England,
may perhaps be thought by some persons to justify the doctrine of an original
compact of government in the sense of those, who deem the constitution of tile
United States a treaty or league between the states, and resting merely in
contract; It is in the following words: "Resolved, that King James the
Second, having endeavoured to subvert the constitution of the kingdom by
breaking the original contract between king and people; and by the advice of
Jesuits and other wicked persons having violated the fundamental laws, and
withdrawn himself out of the kingdom, hath abdicated the government, and that
the throne is thereby become vacant."
<sup>
<b>
[45]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 342.
</b>
It is well known, that there was a most serious
difference of opinion between the house of peers and the house of commons upon
the language of this resolution, and especially upon that part, which declared
the abdication and vacancy of the throne. In consequence of which a free
conference was held by committees of {311} both houses, in which the most
animated debates took place between some of the most distinguished men in the
kingdom. But the commons adhering to their vote, the lords finally acceded to
it. The whole debate is preserved; and the reasoning on each side is given at
large.
<sup>
<b>
[46]
</b>
</sup>
In the course of the debate notice was frequently
taken of the expression of breaking the original contract between king and
people. The Bishop of Ely said, "I may say, that this breaking the
original contract is a language, that hath not been long used in this place,
nor known in any of our law books or public records. It is sprung up, but as
taken from some late authors, and those none of the best received; and the very
phrase might bear a great debate, if that were now to be spoken to." --
"The making of new laws being as much a part of the original compact, as
the observing old ones, or any thing else, we are obliged to pursue those laws,
till altered by the legislative power, which, singly or jointly, without the
royal assent, I suppose we do not pretend to." -- "We must think sure
that meant of the compact, that was made at first time, when the government was
first instituted, and the conditions, that each part of the government should
observe on their part; of which this was most fundamental, that king, lords,
and commons in parliament assembled shall have the power of making new laws and
altering of old ones."
<sup>
<b>
[47]
</b>
</sup>
Sir George Treby said,
"We are gone too far, when we offer to inquire into the original contract,
whether any such thing is known, or understood in our law or constitution, and
whether it be new language among us." First, it is a phrase used by the
learned {312}
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hooker in his book of Ecclesiastical Polity, whom I mention as a
valuable authority, &amp;c. "But I have yet a greater authority than this
to influence this matter, and that is your lordship's own, who have agreed to
all the vote, but this word, abdicated, and the vacancy of the throne." He
then supposes the king to say, "The title of kingship I hold by original
contract, and the fundamental constitutions of the government, and my
succession to, and possession of the crown on these terms is a part of that
contract. This part of the contract I am weary of,"
&amp;c.
<sup>
<b>
[48]
</b>
</sup>
The Earl of Nottingham said, "I know no
laws, as laws, but what are fundamental constitutions, as the laws are
necessary so far to support the foundation."
<sup>
<b>
[49]
</b>
</sup>
Sir
Thomas Lee said, "The contract was to settle the constitution, as to the
legislature; and it is true, that it is a part of the contract, the making of
laws, and that those laws should oblige all sides when made. But yet not so as
to exclude this original constitution in all governments, that commence by
compact, that there should be a power in the states to make provision in all
times, and upon all occasions for extraordinary cases of necessity, such as
ours now is."
<sup>
<b>
[50]
</b>
</sup>
Sir George Treby again said, "The
laws made are certainly part of the original contract, and by the laws made,
&amp;c. we are tied up to keep in the hereditary line,"
&amp;c.;
<sup>
<b>
[51]
</b>
</sup>
Mr. Sergeant Holt (afterwards Lord Chief
Justice) said, "The government and magistracy are all under a trust, and
any acting contrary to that trust is a renouncing of the trust, though it be
not a renouncing by formal deed, or it is a plain declaration by act and deed,
though not in writing, {313} that he, who hath the trust, acting contrary, is a
disclaimer of the trust."
<sup>
<b>
[52]
</b>
</sup>
Mr. Sergeant Maynard said,
"The constitution, notwithstanding the vacancy, is the same. The laws,
that are the foundations and rules of that constitution, are the same. But if
there be in any instance a breach of that constitution, that will be an
abdication, and that abdication will confer a
vacancy."
<sup>
<b>
[53]
</b>
</sup>
Lord Nottingham said, "Acting against
a man's trust (says Mr. Sergeant Holt) is a renunciation of that trust. I
agree, it is a violation of his trust to act contrary to it. And he is
accountable for that violation to answer, what the trust suffers out of his own
estate. But I deny it to be presently a renunciation of the trust, and that
such a one is no longer a trustee."
<sup>
<b>
[54]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 343.
</b>
Now it is apparent from the whole reasoning of all the
parties, that they were not considering, how far the original institution of
government was founded in compact, that is, how far society itself was founded
upon a social compact. It was not a question brought into discussion, whether
each of the people contracted with the whole people, or each department of the
government with all others, or each organized community within the realm with
all others, that there should be a frame of government, which should form a
treaty between them, of which each was to judge for himself, and from which
each was at liberty to withdraw at his pleasure, whenever he or they supposed
it broken. All of the speakers on all sides were agreed, that the constitution
was not gone; that it remained in full force, and obligatory upon the whole
people, including the laws made under it, notwithstanding the violations by the
king.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 344.
</b>
{314} The real point before them was upon a contract of a
very different sort, a contract, by which the king upon taking upon himself the
royal office undertook, and bound himself to the whole people to govern them
according to the laws and constitution of the government. It was, then, deemed
a contract on his part singly with the whole people, they constituting an
aggregate body on the other part. It was a contract or pledge by the executive,
called upon to assume an hereditary, kingly authority, to govern according to
the rules prescribed by the form of government, already instituted by the
people. The constitution of government and its limitations of authority were
supposed to be fixed (no matter whether in fiction only, or in fact)
antecedently to his being chosen to the kingly office. We can readily
understand, how such a contract may be formed, and continue even to exist. It
was actually made with William the Third, a few days afterwards; it has been
recently made in 46rance by King Louis Philippe, upon the expulsion of the old
line of the Bourbons. But in both these cases the constitution of government
was supposed to exist independent Or, and antecedent to, this contract. There
was a mere call of a particular party to the throne, already established in the
government, upon certain fundamental conditions, which, if violated by the
incumbent, he broke his contract, and forfeited his right to the crown. But the
constitution of government remained, and the only point left was to supply the
vacancy by a new choice.
<sup>
<b>
[55]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 345.
</b>
Even in this case a part of the people did not undertake
to declare the compact violated, or the throne vacant. The declaration was made
by the peers in {315} their own right, and by the commons by their
representatives, both being assembled in convention expressly to meet the
exigency. "For," says Blackstone, "whenever a question arises
between the society at large, and any magistrate vested with powers originally
delegated by that society, it must be decided by the voice of that society
itself. There is not upon earth any other tribunal to resort
to."
<sup>
<b>
[56]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 346.
</b>
This was precisely the view entertained by the great
revolutionary whigs in 1688. They did not declare the government dissolved,
because the king had violated the fundamental laws and obligations of the
constitution. But they declared, that those acts amounted to a renunciation and
abdication of the government by him; and that the throne was vacant, and must
be supplied by a new choice. The original contract with him was gone. He had
repudiated it; and lost all rights under it. But these violations did not
dissolve the social organization, or vary the existing constitution and laws,
or justify any of the subjects in renouncing their own allegiance to the
government; but only to King James."
<sup>
<b>
[57]
</b>
</sup>
In short, the
government was no more dissolved, than our own would be, if the president of
the United States should violate his constitutional duties, and, upon an
impeachment and trial, should be removed from office.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 347.
</b>
There is no analogy whatsoever between that case, and
the government of the United States, or the social compact, or original
constitution of government {316} adopted by a people. If there were any
analogy, it would follow, that every violation of the constitution of the
United States by any department of the government would amount to a
renunciation by the incumbent or incumbents of all rights and powers conferred
on that department by the constitution, ipso facto, leaving a vacancy to be
filled up by a new choice; a doctrine, that has never yet been broached, and
indeed is utterly unmaintainable, unless that violation is ascertained in some
mode known to the constitution, and a removal takes place accordingly. For
otherwise such a violation by any functionary of the government would amount to
a renunciation of the constitution by all the people of the United States, and
thus produce a dissolution of the government eo instanti; a doctrine so
extravagant, and so subversive of the rights and liberties of the people, and
so utterly at war with all principles of common sense and common Justice, that
it could never find its way into public favour by any ingenuity of reasoning,
or any vagaries of theory.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 348.
</b>
In short, it never entered into the heads of the great
men, who accomplished the glorious revolution of 1688, that a constitution of
government, however originating, whether in positive compact, or in silent
assent and acquiescence, after it was adopted by the people, remained a mere
contract or treaty, open to question by all, and to be annihilated at the will
of any of them for any supposed or real violations of its provisions. They
supposed, that from the moment it became a constitution, it ceased to be a
compact, and became a fundamental law of absolute paramount obligation, until
changed by the whole people in the manner prescribed by its own rules, or by
the implied resulting power, belonging to the people in all cases of necessity
to {317} provide for their own safety. Their reasoning was addressed, not to
the constitution, but to the functionaries, who were called to administer it.
They deemed, that the constitution was immortal, and could not be forfeited;
for it was prescribed by and for the benefit of the people. But they deemed,
and wisely deemed, that magistracy is a trust, a solemn public trust; and he,
who violates his duties, forfeits his own right to office, but cannot forfeit
the rights of the people.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 349.
</b>
The subject has been, thus far, considered chiefly in
reference to the point, how far government is to be considered as a compact, in
the sense of a contract, as contradistinguished from an act of solemn
acknowledgment or assent; and how far our state constitutions are to be deemed
such contracts, rather than fundamental laws, prescribed by the sovereign
power. The conclusion, to which we have arrived, is, that a state constitution
is no farther to be deemed a compact, than that it is a matter of consent by
the people, binding them to obedience to its requisitions; and that its proper
character is that of a fundamental law, prescribed by the will of the majority
of the people of the stale, (who are entitled to prescribe it,) for the
government and regulation of the whole people.
<sup>
<b>
[58]
</b>
</sup>
It binds
them, as a supreme compact, ordained by the sovereign power, {318} and not
merely as a voluntary contract, entered into by parties capable of contracting
and binding, themselves by such terms, as; they choose to
select.
<sup>
<b>
[59]
</b>
</sup>
If this be a correct view of the subject, it will
enable us to enter upon the other parts of the proposed discussion with
principles to guide us in the illustration of the controversy.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 350.
</b>
In what light, then, is the constitution of the United
States to be regarded? Is it a mere compact, treaty, or confederation of the
states composing the Union, or of the people thereof, whereby each of the
several states, and the people thereof, have respectively bound themselves to
each other? Or is it a form of government, which, having been ratified by a
majority of the people in all the states, is obligatory upon them, as the
prescribed rule of conduct of the sovereign power, to the extent of its
provisions?
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 351.
</b>
Let us consider, in the first place, whether it is to be
deemed a compact? By this, we do not mean an act of solemn assent by the people
to it, as a form of government, (of which there is no room for doubt;) but a
contract imposing mutual obligations, and contemplating the permanent
subsistence of parties having an independent right to construe, control, and
judge of its obligations. If in this latter sense it is to be deemed a compact,
it must be, either because it contains on its face stipulations to that effect,
or because it is necessarily implied from the nature and objects of a frame of
government.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 352.
</b>
There is nowhere found upon the face of the constitution
any clause, intimating it to be a compact, or in anywise providing for its
interpretation, as such. {319} On the contrary, the preamble emphatically
speaks of it, as a solemn ordinance and establishment of government. The
language is, "We, the people of the United States, do ordain and establish
this constitution for the United States of America." The people do ordain
and establish, not contract and stipulate with each
other.
<sup>
<b>
[60]
</b>
</sup>
The people of the United States, not the distinct
people of a particular state with the people of the other states. The people
ordain and establish a "constitution," not a
"confederation." The distinction between a constitution and a
confederation is well known and understood. The latter, or at least a pure
confederation, is a mere treaty or league between independent states, and binds
no longer, than during, the good pleasure of each.
<sup>
<b>
[61]
</b>
</sup>
It
rests forever in articles of compact, where each is, or may be the supreme
judge of its own rights and duties. The former is a permanent form of
government, where the powers, once given, are irrevocable, and cannot be
resumed or withdrawn at pleasure. Whether formed by a single people, or by
different societies of people, {320} in their political capacity, a
constitution, though originating in consent, becomes, when ratified,
obligatory, as a fundamental ordinance or law.
<sup>
<b>
[62]
</b>
</sup>
The
constitution of a confederated republic, that is, of a national republic formed
of several states, is, or at least may be, not less an irrevokable form of
government, than the constitution of a state formed and ratified by the
aggregate of the several counties of the state.
<sup>
<b>
[63]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 353.
</b>
If it had been the design of the framers of the
constitution or of the people, who ratified it, to consider it a mere
confederation, resting on treaty stipulations, it is difficult to conceive,
that the appropriate terms should not have been found in it. The United States
were no strangers to compacts of this nature.
<sup>
<b>
[64]
</b>
</sup>
They had
subsisted to a limited extent before the revolution. The articles of
confederation, though in some few respects national, were mainly of a pure
federative character, and were treated as stipulations between states for many
purposes independent and sovereign.
<sup>
<b>
[65]
</b>
</sup>
And yet (as has been
already seen) it was deemed a political heresy to maintain, that under it any
state had a right {321} to withdraw from it at pleasure, and repeal its
operation; and that a party to the compact had a right to revoke that
compact.
<sup>
<b>
[66]
</b>
</sup>
The only places, where the terms, confederation
or compact, are found in the constitution, apply to subjects of an entirely
different nature, and manifestly in contradistinction to constitution. Thus, in
the tenth section of the first article it is declared, that "no state
shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;" "no state
shall, without the consent of congress, &amp;c. enter into any agreement or
compact with another state, or with a foreign power." Again, in the sixth
article it is declared, that "all debts contracted, and engagements
entered into, before the adoption of this constitution, shall be as valid
against the United States under this constitution, as under the
confederation." Again, in the tenth amendment it is declared, that
"the powers not delegated by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the
states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." A
contract can in no just sense be called a delegation of powers.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 354.
</b>
But that, which would seem conclusive on the subject,
(as has been already stated,) is, the very language of the constitution itself,
declaring it to be a supreme fundamental law, and to be of judicial obligation,
and recognition in the administration of justice. "This
constitution," says the sixth article, "and the laws of the United
States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or
which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the
supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,
any thing in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary {322}
notwithstanding." If it is the supreme law, how can the people of any
state, either by any form of its own constitution, or laws, or other
proceedings, repeal, or abrogate, or suspend it?
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 355.
</b>
But, if the language of the constitution were less
explicit and irresistible, no other inference could be correctly deduced from a
view of the nature and objects of the instrument. The design is to establish a
form of government. This, of itself, imports legal obligation, permanence, and
uncontrollability by any, but the authorities authorized to alter, or abolish
it. The object was to secure the blessings of liberty to the people, and to
their posterity. The avowed intention was to supercede the old confederation,
and substitute in its place a new form of government. We have seen, that the
inefficiency of the old confederation forced the states to surrender the league
then existing, and to establish a national constitution.
<sup>
<b>
[67]
</b>
</sup>
The convention also, which framed the constitution, declared this in the letter
accompanying it. "It is obviously impracticable in the federal government
of these states," says that letter, "to secure all rights of
independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of
all. Individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to
preserve the rest."
<sup>
<b>
[68]
</b>
</sup>
"In all our {323}
deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view that, which
appeared to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation
of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps
our national existence." Could this be attained consistently with the
notion of an existing treaty or confederacy, which each at its pleasure was at
liberty to dissolve?
<sup>
<b>
[69]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 356.
</b>
It is also historically known, that one of the
objections taken by the opponents of the constitution was, " that it is
not a confederation of the states, but a government of
individuals."
<sup>
<b>
[70]
</b>
</sup>
It was, nevertheless, in the solemn
instruments of ratification by the people of the several states, assented to,
as a constitution. The language of those instruments uniformly is, "We,
&amp;c. do assent to, and ratify the said
constitution."
<sup>
<b>
[71]
</b>
</sup>
The forms of the convention of
Massachusetts and NewHampshire are somewhat peculiar in their language.
"The convention, &amp;c. acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the goodness
of the Supreme Ruler of the {324} Universe in affording the people of the
United States, in the course of his providence, an opportunity, deliberately
and peaceably, without force or surprise, of entering into an explicit and
solemn compact with each other, by assenting to, and ratifying a new
constitution, &amp;c. do assent to, and ratify the said
constitution."
<sup>
<b>
[72]
</b>
</sup>
And although many declarations of
rights, many propositions of amendments, and many protestations of reserved
powers are to be found accompanying the ratifications of the various
conventions, sufficiently evincive of the extreme caution and jealousy or those
bodies, and of the people at large, it is remarkable, that there is nowhere to
be found the slightest allusion to the instruments as a confederation or
compact of states in their sovereign capacity, and no reservation of any right,
on the part of any state, to dissolve its connexion, or to abrogate its assent,
or to suspend the operations of the constitution, as to itself. On the
contrary, that of Virginia, which speaks most pointedly to the topic, merely
declares, "that the powers granted under the constitution, being derived
from the people of the United States, may be resumed by them [not by any one of
the states] whenever the same shall be perverted to their injury or
oppression."
<sup>
<b>
[73]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 357.
</b>
So that there is very strong negative testimony against
the notion of its being a compact or confederation, of the nature of which we
have spoken, founded upon the known history of the times, and the acts of
ratification, as well as upon the antecedent articles of confederation. The
latter purported on their {325} face to be a mere confederacy. The language of
the third article was, "The said states hereby severally enter into a firm
league of friendship with each other for their common defence, &amp;c. binding
themselves to assist each other." And the ratification was by delegates of
the state legislatures, who solemnly plighted and engaged the faith of their
respective constituents, that they should abide by the determination of the
United States in congress assembled on all questions, which, by the said
confederation, are submitted to them; and that the articles thereof should be
inviolably observed by the states they respectively
represented.
<sup>
<b>
[74]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 358.
</b>
It is not unworthy of observation, that in the debates
of the various conventions called to examine and ratify the constitution, this
subject did not pass without discussion. The opponents, on many occasions,
pressed the objection, that it was a consolidated government, and contrasted it
with the confederation.
<sup>
<b>
[75]
</b>
</sup>
None of its advocates pretended
to deny, that its design was to establish a national government, as
contradistinguished from a mere league or treaty, however they might oppose the
suggestions, that it was a consolidation of the states.
<sup>
<b>
[76]
</b>
</sup>
In the North Carolina {326} debates, one of the members laid it down, as a
fundamental principle of every sale and free government, that "a
government is a compact between the rulers and the people." This was most
strenuously denied on the other side by gentlemen of great eminence. They said,
"A compact cannot be annulled, but by the consent of both parties.
Therefore, unless the rulers are guilty of oppression, the people, on the
principles of a compact, have no right to new-model their government. This is
held to be the principle of some monarchical governments in Europe. Our
government is founded on much nobler principles. The people are known with
certainty to have originated it themselves. Those in power are their servants
and agents. And the people, without their consent, may new-model the
government, whenever they think proper, not merely because it is oppressively
exercised, but because they think another form will be more conducive to their
welfare."
<sup>
<b>
[77]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 359.
</b>
Nor should it be omitted, that in the most elaborate
expositions of the constitution by its friends, its character, as a permanent
form of government, as a fundamental law, as a supreme rule, which no state was
at liberty to disregard, suspend, or annul, was constantly admitted, and insist
ed on, as one of the strongest reasons, why it should be adopted in lieu of the
confederation.
<sup>
<b>
[78]
</b>
</sup>
It is matter of surprise, therefore, that
{327} a learned commentator should have admitted the right of any state, or of
the people of any state, without the consent of the rest, to secede from the
Union at its own pleasure.
<sup>
<b>
[79]
</b>
</sup>
The people of the United
States have a right to abolish, or alter the constitution of the United States;
but that the people of a single state have such a right, is a proposition
requiring some reasoning beyond the suggestion, that it is implied in the
principles, on which our political systems are founded.
<sup>
<b>
[80]
</b>
</sup>
It seems, indeed, to have its origin in the notion of all governments being
founded in compact, and therefore liable to be dissolved by the parties, or
either of them; a notion, which it has been our purpose to question, at least
in the sense, to which the objection applies.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 360.
</b>
To us the doctrine of Mr. Dane appears far better
founded, that "the constitution of the United States is not a compact or
contract agreed to by two or more parties, to be construed by each for itself,
and here to stop for the want of a common arbiter to revise the construction of
each party or state. But that it is, as the people have named and called it,
truly a Constitution; and they properly said, ' We, the people of the United
States, do ordain and establish this constitution,' and not, we, the people of
each state."
<sup>
<b>
[81]
</b>
</sup>
And this {328} exposition has been
sustained by opinions of some of our most eminent statesmen and
judges.
<sup>
<b>
[82]
</b>
</sup>
It was truly remarked by the
Federalist,
<sup>
<b>
[83]
</b>
</sup>
that the constitution was the result neither
from the decision of a majority of the people of the union, nor from that of a
majority of the states. It resulted from the unanimous assent of the several
states that are parties to it, differing no otherwise from their ordinary
assent, than its being expressed, not by the legislative authority but by that
of the people themselves.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 361.
</b>
But if the constitution could in the sense, to to which
we have alluded, be deemed a compact, between whom is it to be deemed a
contract? We have already seen, that the learned commentator on Blackstone,
deems it a compact with several aspects, and first between the states, (as
contradistinguished from the people of the states) by which the several states
have bound themselves to each other, and to the {329} federal
government.
<sup>
<b>
[84]
</b>
</sup>
The Virginia Resolutions of 1798, assert,
that "Virginia views the powers of the federal government, as resulting
from the compact, to which the states are parties." This declaration was,
at the time, matter of much debate and difference of opinion among the ablest
representatives in the legislature. But when it was subsequently expounded by
Mr. Madison in the celebrated Report of January, 1800, after admitting, that
the term "states" is used in different senses, and among others, that
it sometimes means the people composing a political society in their highest
sovereign capacity, he considers the resolution unobjectionable, at least in
this last sense, because in that sense the constitution was submitted to the
"states"; in that sense the "states" ratified it; and in
that sense the states are consequently parties to the compact, from which the
powers of the federal government result.
<sup>
<b>
[85]
</b>
</sup>
And that is the
sense, in which he considers the states parties in his still later and more
deliberate examinations.
<sup>
<b>
[86]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 362.
</b>
This view of the subject is, however, wholly at variance
with that, on which we are commenting; and which, having no foundation in the
words of the constitution, is altogether a gratuitous assumption, and therefore
inadmissible. It is no more true, that a state is a party to the constitution,
as such, because it was framed by delegates chosen by the states, and submitted
by the legislatures thereof to the people of the states for ratification, and
that the states are necessary agents to give effect to some of its provisions,
than that {330} for the same reasons the governor, or senate, or house of
representatives, or judges, either of a state or of the United States, are
parties thereto. No state, as such, that is the body politic, as it was
actually organized, had any power to establish a contract for the establishment
of any new government over the people thereof, or to delegate the powers of
government in whole, or in part to any other sovereignty. The state governments
were framed by the people to administer the state constitutions, such as they
were, and not to transfer the administration thereof to any other persons, or
sovereignty. They had no authority to enter into any compact or contract for
such a purpose. It is no where given, or implied in the state constitutions;
and consequently, if actually entered into, (as it was not,) would have had no
obligatory force. The people, and the people only, in their original sovereign
capacity, had a right to change their form of government, to enter into a
compact, and to transfer any sovereignty to the national
government.
<sup>
<b>
[87]
</b>
</sup>
And the states never, in fact, did in their
political capacity, as contradistinguished from the people thereof, ratify the
constitution. They were not called upon to do it by congress; and were not
contemplated, as essential to give validity to it.
<sup>
<b>
[88]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 363.
</b>
{331} The doctrine, then, that the states are parties is
a gratuitous assumption. In the language of a most {332} distinguished
statesman,
<sup>
<b>
[89]
</b>
</sup>
"the constitution itself in its very
front refutes that. It declares, that it is ordained and established by the
PEOPLE of the United States. So far from saying, that it is established by the
governments of the several states, it does not even say, that it is established
by the people of the several states. But it pronounces, that it is established
by the people of the United States in the aggregate. Doubtless the people of
the several states, taken collectively, constitute the people of the United
States. But it is in this their collective capacity, it is as all the people of
the United States, that they establish the
constitution."
<sup>
<b>
[90]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 364.
</b>
{333} But if it were admitted, that the constitution is a
compact between the states, "the inferences deduced from it," as has
been justly observed by the same statesman,
<sup>
<b>
[91]
</b>
</sup>
"are
warranted by no just reason. Because, if the constitution be a compact between
the states, still that constitution or that compact has established a
government with certain powers; and whether it be one of these powers, that it
shall construe and interpret for itself the terms of the compact in doubtful
cases, can only be decided by looking to the compact, and inquiring, what
provisions it contains on that point. Without any inconsistency with natural
reason, the government even thus created might be trusted with this power of
construction. The extent of its powers must, therefore, be sought in the
instrument itself." "If the constitution were the mere creation of
the state governments, it might be modified, interpreted, or construed
according to their pleasure. But even in that case, it would be necessary, that
they should agree. One alone could not interpret it conclusively. One alone
could not construe it. One alone could not modify it." "If all the
states are parties to it, one alone can have no right to fix upon it her own
peculiar construction."
<sup>
<b>
[92]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 365.
</b>
{334} Then, is it a compact between the people of the
several states, each contracting with all the people of the other
states?
<sup>
<b>
[93]
</b>
</sup>
It may be admitted, as was the early exposition
of its advocates, "that the constitution is founded on the assent and
ratification of the people of America, given by deputies elected for the
special purpose; but that this assent and ratification is to be given by the
whole people, not as individuals, composing one entire nation, but as composing
the distinct and independent states, to which they respectively belong. It is
to be the assent and ratification of the several states, derived from the
supreme authority in each state, the authority of the people themselves. The
act, therefore, establishing the constitution will not be [is not to be] a
national, but a federal act."
<sup>
<b>
[94]
</b>
</sup>
"It may also be
admitted," in the language of one of its most enlightened commentators,
that "it was formed, not by the governments of the component states, as
the federal government, for which it was substituted, was formed. Nor was it
formed by a majority of the people of the United States, as a single community,
in the manner of a consolidated government. It was formed by the states, that
is, by the people in each of the states acting m their highest sovereign
capacity; and formed consequently by the same authority, which formed the state
constitutions."
<sup>
<b>
[95]
</b>
</sup>
But this would not necessarily {335}
draw after it the conclusion, that it was to be deemed a compact, (in the
sense, to which we have so often alluded,) by which each state was still, after
the ratification, to act upon it, as a league or treaty, and to withdraw from
it at pleasure. A government may originate in the voluntary compact or assent
of the people of several states, or of a people never before united, and yet
when adopted and ratified by them, be no longer a matter resting in compact;
but become an executed government or constitution, a fundamental law, and not a
mere league. But the difficulty in asserting it to be a compact between the
people of each state, and all the people of the other states is, that the
constitution itself contains no such expression, and no such designation of
parties.
<sup>
<b>
[96]
</b>
</sup>
We, "the people of the United States,
&amp;c. do ordain, and establish this constitution," is the language; and
not we, the people of each state, do establish this compact between ourselves,
and the people of all the other states. We are obliged to depart from the words
of the instrument, to sustain the other interpretation; an interpretation,
which can serve no better purpose, than to confuse the mind in relation to a
subject otherwise clear. It is for this reason, that we should prefer an
adherence to the words of the constitution, and to the judicial exposition of
these words according to their plain and common import.
<sup>
<b>
[97]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 366.
</b>
{336} But supposing, that it were to be deemed such a
compact among the people of the several states, let us see what the enlightened
statesman, who {337} vindicates that opinion, holds as the appropriate
deduction from it. "Being thus derived (says he) from the same source, as
the constitutions of the states, it has, within each state, the same authority,
as the constitution of the state; and is as much a constitution within the
strict sense of the term, within its prescribed sphere, as the constitutions of
the states are, within their respective spheres. But with this obvious and
essential differe nce, that being a compact among the states in their highest
sovereign capacity, and constituting the people thereof one people for certain
purposes, it cannot be altered, or annulled at the will of the states
individually, as the constitution of a state may be at its individual
will."
<sup>
<b>
[98]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 367.
</b>
{338} The other branch of the proposition, we have been
considering, is, that it is not only a compact between the several states, and
the people thereof, but also a compact between the states and the federal
government; and e converso between the federal government, and the several
states, and every citizen of the United States.
<sup>
<b>
[99]
</b>
</sup>
This
seems to be a doctrine far more involved, and extraordinary, and
incomprehensible, than any part of the preceding. The difficulties have not
escaped the observation of those, by whom it has been advanced. "Although
(says the learned commentator) the federal government can, in no possible view,
be considered as a party to a compact made anterior to its existence; yet, as
the creature of that compact, it must be bound by it to its creators, the
several states in the Union, and the citizens
thereof."
<sup>
<b>
[100]
</b>
</sup>
If by this, no more were meant than to
state, that the federal government cannot lawfully exercise any powers, except
those conferred on it by the constitution, its truth could not admit of
dispute. But it is plain, that something more was in the author's mind. At the
same time, that he admits, that the federal government could not be a party to
the compact of the constitution "in any possible view," he still
seems to insist upon it, as a compact, by which the federal government is bound
to the several states, and to every citizen; that is, that it has entered into
a contract with them for the due execution of its duties.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 368.
</b>
{339} And a doctrine of a like nature, viz. that the
federal government is a party to the compact, seems to have been gravely
entertained on other solemn occasions.
<sup>
<b>
[101]
</b>
</sup>
The difficulty of
maintaining it, however, seems absolutely insuperable. The federal government
is the result of the constitution, or (if the phrase is deemed by any person
more appropriate) the creature o the compact. How, then, can it be a party to
that compact, to which it owes its own existence?
<sup>
<b>
[102]
</b>
</sup>
How
can it be said, that it has entered into a contract, when at the time it had no
capacity to conduct; and was not even in esse? If any provision was made for
the general government's becoming a party, and entering into a compact, after
it was brought into existence, where is that provision to be found? It is not
to be found in the constitution itself. Are we at liberty to imply such a
provision, attaching to no power given in the constitution? This would be to
push the doctrine of implication to an extent truly alarming; to draw
inferences, not from what is, but from what is not, stated in the instrument.
But, if any such implication could exist, when did the general government
signify its assent to become such a party? When did the people authorize it to
do so?
<sup>
<b>
[103]
</b>
</sup>
Could the government do so, without the express
authority of the people? These are questions, which are more easily asked, than
answered.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 369.
</b>
In short, the difficulties attendant upon all the
various theories under consideration, which treat the constitution of the
United States, as a compact, either between the several states, or between the
people {340} of the several states, or between the whole people of the United
States, and the people of the several states, or between each citizen of all
the states, and all other citizens, are, if not absolutely insuperable, so
serious, and so wholly founded upon mere implication, that it is matter of
surprise, that they should have been so extensively adopted, and so zealously
propagated. These theories, too, seem mainly urged with a view to draw
conclusions, which are at war with the known powers, and reasonable objects of
the constitution; and which, if successful, would reduce the government to a
mere confederation. They are objectionable, then, in every way; first, because
they are not justified by the language of the constitution; secondly, because
they have a tendency to impair, and indeed to destroy, its express powers and
objects; and thirdly, because they involve consequences, which, at the will of
a single state, may overthrow the constitution itself. One of the fundamental
rules in the exposition of every instrument is, so to construe its terms, if
possible, as not to make them the source of their own destruction, or to make
them utterly void, and nugatory. And if this be generally true, with how much
more force does the rule apply to a constitution of government, framed for the
general good, and designed for perpetuity? Surely, if any implications are to
be made beyond its terms, they are implications to preserve, and not to destroy
it.
<sup>
<b>
[104]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 370.
</b>
{341} The cardinal conclusion, for which this doctrine of
a compact has been, with so much ingenuity and ability, forced into the
language of the constitution, (for the language no where alludes to it,) is
avowedly to establish, that in construing the constitution, there is no common
umpire; but that each state, nay each department of the government of each
state, is the supreme judge for itself, of the powers, and rights, and duties,
arising under that instrument.
<sup>
<b>
[105]
</b>
</sup>
Thus, it has been
solemnly asserted on more than one occasion, by some of the state legislatures,
that there is no common arbiter, or tribunal, authorized to decide in the last
resort, upon the powers and the interpretation of the constitution. And the
doctrine has been recently revived with extraordinary zeal, and vindicated with
uncommon vigour.
<sup>
<b>
[106]
</b>
</sup>
A majority of the states, however, have
never {342} assented to this doctrine; and it has been, at different times,
resisted by the legislatures of several of the states, in the most formal
declarations.
<sup>
<b>
[107]
</b>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 371.
</b>
But if it were admitted, that the constitution is a
compact, the conclusion, that there is no common arbiter, would neither be a
necessary, nor natural conclusion from that fact standing alone. To decide upon
the point, it would still behove us to examine the very terms of the
constitution, and the delegation of powers under it. It would be perfectly
competent even for confederated states to agree upon, and delegate authority to
construe the compact to a common arbiter. The people of the United States had
an unquestionable right to confide this power to the government of the United
States, or to any department thereof, if they chose so {343} to do. The
question is, whether they have done it. If they have, it becomes obligatory and
binding upon all the states.
</p>
<p>
<b>
§ 372.
</b>
It is not, then, by artificial reasoning founded upon
theory, but upon a careful survey of the language of the constitution itself,
that we are to interpret its powers, and its obligations. We are to treat it,
as it purports on its face to be, as a CONSTITUTION of government; and we are
to reject all other appellations, and definitions of it, such, as that it is a
compact, especially as they may mislead us into false constructions and
glosses, and can have no tendency to instruct us in its real objects.

The result will show,that, on revolutionary principles, the general government was, by the sovereignof this people first create de novo,and de facto instituted; and, by the sameacts, the people vested in it very extensive powers, which have ever remainedin it, modified and defined by the articles of confederation, and enlarged andarranged anew by the constitution of the United States -- 2d. that the stategovernments and states, as free and independent states, were, July 4th, 1776,created by the general government, empowered to do it by the people, acting onrevolutionary principles, and in their original sovereign capacity; and thatall the state governments, as such, have been instituted during the existenceof the general government, and in subordination to it, and two thirds of themsince the constitution of the United States was ordained and established by allthe people thereof in that sovereign capacity.

The Kentucky Resolutions of 1797, which were drafted by Mr. Jefferson,declare, "that to this compact [the federal constitution] each stateacceded as a state, and is an integral party." North American Review, Oct.1830, p. 501, 545. In the resolutions of the senate of South Carolina, in Nov.1817, it is declared, "that the constitution of the United States is acompact between the people of the different states with each other, as separateand independent sovereignties." In Nov. 1799 the Kentucky legislaturepassed a resolution, declaring, that the federal states had a right to judge ofany infraction of the constitution, and, that a nullification by thosesovereignties of all unauthorized acts done under color of that instrument isthe rightful remedy. North American Review, Id. 503. Mr. Madison, in theVirginia Report of 1800, re-asserts the right of the states, as parties, todecide upon the unconstitutionality of any measure. Report. p. 6, 7, 8, 9. TheVirginia legislature, in 1829, passed a resolution, declaring, that " theconstitution of the United States being a federative compact between sovereignstates, in construing which no common arbiter is known, each state has theright to construe the compact for itself.[14.1]Mr. Vice President Calhoun's letter to Gov.Hamilton of Aug. 28, 1832, contains a very elaborate exposition of this amongother doctrines. Mr. Dane, in his Appendix, (§ 3, p. 11,) says, that for forty yearsone great party has received the constitution, as a federative compact amongthe states, and the other great party, not as such a compact, but in the main,national and popular. The grave debate in the Senate of the United States, onMr. Foot's resolution, in the winter of 1830, deserves to be read for its ableexposition of the doctrines maintained on each slide.

<li><a id="015"></a>Virginia, in the resolutions of her legislature on thetariff, in Feb. 1829, declared, "that there is no common arbiter toconstrue the constitution; being a federative compact between sovereign states,each state has a right to construe the compact for itself." 9 Dane'sAbridg. ch. 187, art. 20, § 14, p. 589. See also North American Review,Oct. 1830, p. 488 to 528. The resolutions of Kentucky of 1798 contain a likedeclaration, that "to this compact [the constitution] each state accededas a state, and is an integral party; that the government created by thiscompact was not made the exclusive, or final judge of the powers delegated toitself, &c.; but that, as in all other cases of compact among partieshaving no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, aswell of infractions, as of the mode and measure of redress." NorthAmerican Review, Oct. 1830, p. 501. The Kentucky resolutions of 1799 gofurther, and assert, "that the several states, who formed that instrument,[the constitution] being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionableright to judge of its infraction; and that a nullification by thosesovereignties of all unauthorized acts done under colour of that instrument isthe rightful remedy." North American Review, Id. 503; 4 Elliot's Debates,315, 322. In Mr. Madison's Report in the Virginia legislature, in January,1800, it is also affirmed, that the states are parties to the constitution; butby states he here means (as the context explains) the people of the states.That report insists, that the states are in the last resort the ultimate judgesof the infractions of the constitution. p. 6, 7, 8, 9.</li>

He founds all civil government uponconsent. "When," says he, "any number of men have so consentedto make a community of government, they are thereby presently incorporated, andmake one body politic, wherein the majority have a right to act, and concludethe rest."[24.1]And he considersthis consent to be bound by the will of the majority, as the indispensableresult of becoming a community; "else," says he, "this originalcompact, whereby he, with others, incorporates into one society, would signifynothing, and be no compact at all."[24.2]Doctor Paley has urged some very forcibleobjections against this doctrine, both as matter of theory and of fact, withwhich, however, it is unnecessary here to intermeddle. The discussion of themwould more properly belong to lectures upon natural and politicallaw.[24.3]Mr. Burke has, in one of hismost splendid performances, made some profound reflections on this subject, theconclusion of which seems to be, that of society is to be deemed a contract, itis one of eternal obligation, and not liable to be dissolved at the will ofthose, who have entered into it. The passage is as follows: "Society isindeed a contract. Subordinate contracts for objects of more occasionalinterest may be deposited at pleasure. But the state ought not to be consideredas nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee,calico or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken up for a littletemporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties. It is tobe looked on with other reverence; because it is not a partnership in things,subservient only to the gross animal existence, of a temporary and perishablenature. It is a partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; apartnership in every virtue, and in all perfection. As the ends of such apartnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnershipnot only between those, who are living, but between those, who are living,those, who are dead, and those, who are to be born. Each contract of eachparticular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract of eternalsociety, linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the visible andinvisible world, according, to a fixed compact, sanctioned by the inviolableoath, which holds all physical and all moral natures, each in their appointedplace. This law is not subject to the will of those, who by an obligation abovethem, and infinitely superior are bound to submit their will to that law. Themunicipal corporations of that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty attheir pleasure, and on their speculations of a contingent improvement, whollyto separate and tear asunder the bands of their subordinate community, and todissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos of elementaryprinciples. It is the first and supreme necessity only, a necessity, that isnot chosen, but chooses, a necessity paramount to deliberation, that admits nodiscussion, and demands no evidence, which alone can justify a resort toanarchy. This necessity is no exception to the rule; because this necessityitself is a part too of that moral and physical disposition of things, to whichman must he obedient by consent or force. But, if that, which is onlysubmission to necessity, should be made the object of choice, the law isbroken, nature is disobeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, east forth, andexiled from this world of reason, and order, and peace, and virtue, andfruitful penitence, into the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice,confusion, and unavailing sorrow."

Here is an expressenumeration of parties, some of whom were not then in existence, and thearticles of compact attached as such only, when they were brought into life.And then to avoid all doubt, as to their obligatory force, they were to beunalterable, except by common consent.

<li><a id="032"></a>It was the consideration of the consequences deduciblefrom the theory of an original subsisting compact between the people, upon thefirst formation of civil societies and governments, that induced Doctor Paleyto reject it. He supposed, that, if admitted, its fundamental principles werestill disputable and uncertain; that, if founded on compact, the form ofgovernment, however absurd or inconvenient, was still obligatory; and thatevery violation of the compact involved a right of rebellion and a dissolutionof the government.[32.1]Mr. Wilson(afterwards Mr. Justice Wilson) urged the same objection very forcibly in thePennsylvanian Convention for adopting the constitution. 3 Elliot's Debates,286, 287, 288.

However questionable this latter position may be,(and it is open to many objections,[34.1]) it is certain, that a right of the minorityto withdraw from the government, and to overthrow its powers, has no foundationin any just reasoning. 34.1.

<li><a id="044"></a>Mr. Adams, in his Oration on the 4th of July, 1831,uses the following language: "In the constitution of this commonwealth[Massachusetts] it is declared, that the body politic is formed by a voluntaryassociation of individuals. That it is a social compact, &c. The bodypolitic of the United States was formed by a voluntary association of thepeople of the United Colonies. The Declaration of Independence was a socialcompact, by which the whole people covenanted with each citizen of the unitedcolonies, and each citizen with the whole people, that the united colonieswere, and of right ought to be, free and independent states. To this compact,union was as vital, as freedom and independence. From the hour of thatindependence, no one of the states, whose people were parties to it, could,without a violation of that primitive compact, secede, or separate from therest. Each was pledged to all; and all were pledged to each other by a concertof soul, without limitation of time, in the presence of Almighty God, andproclaimed to all mankind. The colonies were not declared to be sovereignstates. The term 'sovereign' is not even to be found in the Declaration."Again -- "Our Declaration of Independence, our confederation, ourconstitution of the United States, and all our state constitutions, without asingle exception, have been voluntary compacts, deriving all their authorityfrom the free consent of the parties to them." And he proceeds to state,that the modern doctrine of nullification of the laws of the Union by a singlestate, is a solecism of language, and imports selfcontradiction; and goes tothe destruction of the government, and the Union. It is plain, from the wholereasoning of Mr. Adams, that when be speaks of the constitution as a compact,he means no more, than that it is a voluntary and solemn consent of the peopleto adopt it, as a form of government; and not a treaty obligation to beabrogated at will by a single state.</li>

No. It is neither more nor lessthan a law, made by competent authority, upon an assent or agreement of minds.In Martin v. Hunter, (1 Wheat.

It has been said, that they were sovereign,were completely independent, and were connected with each other only by aleague. This is true. But, when these allied sovereigns converted their leagueinto a government, when they converted their Congress of Ambassadors, deputedto deliberate on their common concerns, and to recommend measures of generalutility, into a legislature, empowered to enact laws on the most interestingsubjects, the whole character, in which the states appear, underwent a change,the extent of which must be determined by a fair consideration of theinstrument, by which that change was effected."</li>

<li><a id="081"></a>Mr. (afterwards Mr. Justice) Wilson, who was a member of the FederalConvention, uses, in the Pennsylvania Debates, the following language: "Wewere told, &c. that the convention no doubt thought they were forming acompact or contract of the greatest importance. It was matter of surprise tosee the great lending principles of this system still so very muchmisunderstood. I cannot answer for what every member thought; but I believe itcannot be said, they thought they were making a contract, because I cannotdiscover the least trace of a compact in that system. There can be no compact,unless there are more parties than one. It is a new doctrine, that one can makea compact with himself. 'The convention were forming contracts! with whom? Iknow no bargains, that were there made, I am unable to conceive, who thepatties could be. The state governments make a bargain with each other. That isthe doctrine, that is endeavoured to be established by gentlemen in theopposition; their state sovereignties wish to be represented. But far otherwere the ideas of the convention. This is not a government founded uponcompact. It is founded upon the power of the people. They express in their nameand their authority, we, the people, do ordain and establish," &c. 3Elliot's Debates, 286, 287. He adds (Id. 288) "This system is not acompact or contract. The system tells you, what it is; it is an ordinance andestablishment of the people." 9 Dane's Abridg. ch. 187, art. 20, §15, p. 589, 590; Dane's App. § 10, p. 21, § 50, p. 69.</li>

<li><a id="088"></a>The Federalist, No 39. -- In confirmation of this view, we may quotethe reasoning of the Supreme Court in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, (4Wheaton's R 316,) in answer to the very argument. "The powers of the general government, it has been said,are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must beexercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion. "It would be difficult to sustain this proposition. The convention,which framed the constitution, was indeed elected by the state legislatures.But the instrument, when it came from their hands, was a mere proposal, withoutobligation, or pretensions to it. It was reported to the then existing congressof the United States, with a request, that it might be submitted to aconvention of delegates, chosen in each state by the people thereof, under therecommendation of its legislature, for their assent and ratification.' Thismode of proceeding was adopted; and by the convention, by congress, and by thestate legislatures, the instrument was submitted to the people. They acted uponit in the only manner, in which they can act safely, effectively, and wisely,on such a subject, by assembling in convention. It is true, they assembled intheir several states -- and where else should they have assembled? No politicaldreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines, whichseparate the states, and of compounding the American people into one commonmass. Of consequence, when they act, they act in their states. But the measuresthey adopt do not, on that account, cease to be the measures of the peoplethemselves, or become the measures of the state governments. "From these conventions the constitution derives its whole authority.The government proceeds directly from the people; is ' ordained and established' in the name of the people; and is declared to be ordained, ' in order to forma more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, andsecure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to their posterity.' Theassent of the states, in their sovereign capacity, is implied in calling aconvention, and thus submitting that instrument to the people. But the peoplewere at perfect liberty to accept or reject it; and their act was final. Itrequired not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the stategovernments. The constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation,and bound the state sovereignties. "It has been said, that the people had already surrendered all theirpowers to the state sovereignties, and had nothing more to give. But, surely,the question, whether they may resume and modify the power granted togovernment, does not remain to be settled in this country. Much more might thelegitimacy of the general government be doubted, had it been created by thestates. The powers delegated to the state sovereignties were to be exercised bythemselves, not by a distinct and independent sovereignty, created bythemselves. To the formation of a league, such as was the confederation, thestate sovereignties were certainly competent. But when, ' in order to form amore perfect union,' it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into aneffective government, possessing great and sovereign powers, and actingdirectly on the people, the necessity of referring it to the people, ant ofderiving its power directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all. "The government of the Union, then, (whatever may be the influence ofthis fact on the case,) is, emphatically, and truly, a government of thepeople. In form and in substance it emanates from them. Its powers are grantedby them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit. "This government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumeratedpowers. The principle, that it can exercise only the powers granted to it,would seem too apparent to have required to be enforced by all those arguments,which its enlightened friends, while it was depending before the people, foundit necessary to urge. That principle is now universally admitted. But thequestion respecting the extent of the powers actually granted, is perpetuallyarising, and will probably continue to arise, as long as our system shallexist."</li>

<li><a id="090"></a>Mr. Dane reasons to the same effect, though it is obvious, that hecould not, at the time, have had any knowledge of the views of Mr. Webster.* Headds, " If a contract, when and how did the Union become a party to it? Ifa compact, why is it never so denominated, but often and invariably in theinstrument itself, and in its amendments, styled, " This constitution? andif a contract, why did the framers and people call it the supreme law."#In Martin v. Hunter, (1 Wheat. R. 304, 324,) the supreme court expresslydeclared, that " the constitution was ordained and established," notby the states in their sovereign capacity, but emphatically, as the preamble ofthe constitution declares, " by the people of the United States." * 9 Dane's Abridg. ch. 189, art. 20, § 15, p. 589,590; Dane's App.40,41, 42. # 9 Dane's Abridg. 590.</li>

<li><a id="092"></a>Even under the confederation, which was confessedly, in many respects, amere league or treaty, though in other respects national, congress unanimouslyresolved, that it was not within the competency of any state to pass acts forinterpreting, explaining, or construing a national treaty, or any part orclause of it. Yet in that instrument there was no express judicial powers givento the general government to construe it. It was, however, deemed anirresistible and exclusive authority in the general government, from the verynature of the other powers given to them; and especially from the power to makewar and peace, and to form treaties.

<li><a id="093"></a>In the resolutions passed by the senate of South-Carolina in December,1827, it was declared, that " the constitution of the United States is acompact between the people of the different states with each other, as separateand independent sovereignties." Mr. Grimke filed a protest founded ondifferent views of it.

This subject is considered with much care by President Monroe in hisExposition, accompanying his Message, of the 4th of May, 1822. It is due to hismemory to insert the following passages which exhibits his notion of thesupremacy of the Union. "The constitution of the United States being ratified bythe people of the several states, became, of necessity, to the extent of itspowers, the paramount authority of the Union. On sound principles, it can beviewed in no other light. The people, the highest authority known to oursystem, from whom all our institutions spring, and on whom they depend, formedit. Had the people of the several states thought proper to incorporatethemselves into one community under one government, they might have done it.They had the power, and there was nothing then, nor is there any thing now,should they be so disposed, to prevent it. They wisely stopped, however, at acertain point, extending the incorporation to that point, making the nationalgovernment, thus far, A consolidated government, and preserving the stategovernment, without that limit, perfectly sovereign and independent of thenational government. Had the people of the several states incorporatedthemselves into one community, they must have remained such; their constitutionbecoming then, like the constitutions of the several states, incapable ofchange, until altered by the will of the majority. In the institution of astate government by the citizens of a state, a compact is formed, to which alland every citizen are equal parties. They are also the sole parties; and mayamend it at pleasure. In the institution of the government of the UnitedStates, by the citizens of every state, a compact was formed between the wholeAmerican people, which has the same force, and partakes of all the qualities,to the extent; of its powers, as a compact between the citizens of a state, inthe formation of their own constitution. It cannot be altered, except by thosewho formed it, or in the mode prescribed by the parties to the compact itself. "This constitution was adopted for the purpose of remedying all thedefects of the confederation; and in this, it has succeeded, beyond anycalculation, that could have been formed of any human institution. By bindingthe states together, the constitution performs the great office of theconfederation, but it is in that sense only, that it has any of the propertiesof that compact, and in that it is more effectual, to the purpose, as it holdsthem together by a much stronger bond, and in all other respects, in which theconfederation failed, the constitution has been blessed with complete success.The confederation was a compact between separate and independent states; theexecution of whose articles, in the powers which operated internally, dependedon the state governments. But the great office of the constitution, byincorporating the people of the several states, to the extent of its powers,into one community, and enabling it to act directly on the people, was to annulthe powers of the state government to that extent, except in cases where theywere concurrent, and to preclude their agency in giving effect to those of thegeneral government. The government of the United States relies on its own meansfor the execution of its powers, as the state government do for the executionof theirs; both governments having, a common origin, or sovereign, the people;the state governments, the people of each state, the national government, thepeople of every state; and being amenable to the power, which created it. It isby executing its functions as a government, thus originating and thus acting,that the constitution of the United States holds the states together, andperforms the office of a league. It is owing to the nature of its powers, andthe high source, from whence they are derived, the people, that it performsthat office better than the confederation, or any league, whichever existed,being a compact, which the state governments did not form, to which they arenot parties, and which executes its own powers independently of them."</li>
<li><a id="098"></a>Mr. Madison's Letter, North American Review, Oct. 1830, p. 538. -- Mr.Paterson (afterwards Mr. Justice Paterson) in the convention, which framed theconstitution, held the doctrine, that under the confederation no state had aright to withdraw from the Union without the consent of all. " Theconfederation (said he) is in the nature of a compact; and can any state,unless by the consent of the whole, either in politics or law, withdraw theirpowers? Let it be said by Pennsylvania and the other large states, that they,for the sake of peace, assented to the confederation; can she now resume heroriginal right without the consent of the donee?" * Mr. Dane unequivocallyholds the same language in respect to the constitution. "It is clear (sayshe) the people of any one state alone never can take, or withdraw power fromthe United States, which was granted to it by all, as the people of all thestates can do rightfully in a justifiable revolution, or as the people can doin the manner their constitution prescribes." Dane's App. § 10, p.21. * Yates's debates, 4 Elliot's Debates, 75. The ordinance of 1787, for the government of the western territory, contains(as we have seen) certain articles declared to be " articles ofcompact;" but they are also declared to " remain for everunalterable, except by common consent." So, that there may be a compactand yet by the stipulations neither party may be at liberty to withdraw fromit, or absolve itself from its obligations. Ante, p. 209.</li>

<li><a id="104"></a>The following strong language is extracted from Instruction given tosome Representatives of the state of Virginia by their constituents in 1787,with reference to the confederation: " Government without coercion is aproposition at once so absurd and self contradictory, that the idea creates aconfusion of the understanding. It is form without substance; at best a bodywithout a soul. If men would act right, government of all kinds would beuseless. If states or nations, who are but assemblages of men, would do right,there would be no wars or disorders in the universe. Bad as individuals are, states are worse. Clothe men with public authority,and almost universally they consider themselves, as liberated from theobligations of moral rectitude, because they are no longer amenable tojustice." 1 Amer.

<li><a id="106"></a>The legislature of Virginia, in 1829, resolved, that there is nocommon arbiter to construe the constitution of the United States; theconstitution being a federative compact between sovereign states, each statehas a right to construe the compact for itself" Georgia and South-Carolinahave recently maintained the same doctrine; and it has been asserted in thesenate of the United States, with an uncommon display of eloquence andpertinacity.* It is not a little remarkable, that in 1810, the legislature ofVirginia thought very differently, and then deemed the supreme court a fit andimpartial tribunal.# Pennsylvania at the same time, though she did not deny thecourt to be, under the constitution, the appropriate tribunal, was desirous ofsubstituting some other arbiter.+ The recent resolutions of her own legislature(in March, 1831) show, that she now approves of the supreme court, as the trueand common arbiter. One of the expositions of the doctrine is, that if a singlestate denies a power to exist under the constitution, that power is to bedeemed defunct, unless three-fourths of the states shall afterwards reinstatethat power by an amendment to the constitution.* What, then, is to be done,where ten states resolve, that a power exists, and one, that it does not exist?See Mr. Vice-President Calhoun's Letter of 28th August, 1832, to Gov. Hamilton. * Dane's Abridg. ch. 197, art. § 20, to 13, p. 589, &c. 591;Dane's Apr. 52 to 59, 67 to 72; 3 American Annual Register, Local Hist. 131. # North American Review October, 1830. p. 509, 512; 6 Wheat.

<li><a id="107"></a>Massachusetts openly opposed it in the resolutions of her legislatureof the 12th of February, 1799, and declared, " that the decision of allcases in law and equity arising under the constitution of the United States,and the construction of all laws made in pursuance thereof, are exclusivelyvested by the people, in the judicial courts of the United States." # Sixother states, at that time, seem to have come to the same result.+ And on otheroccasions, a Larger number have concurred on the same point.@ Similarresolutions have been passed by the legislatures of Delaware and Connecticut in1834, and by some other states. How is it possible, for a moment, to reconcilethe notion, that each state is the supreme judge for itself of the constructionof the constitution, with the very first resolution of the convention, whichformed the constitution: "Resolved, &c.;that a national governmentought to be established; consisting of a supreme, legislative, judiciary, andexecutive?
