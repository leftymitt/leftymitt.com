  § 373.
 </b>
 THE consideration of the question, whether the constitution has
made provision for any common arbiter to construe its powers and
obligations, would properly find a place in the analysis of the different
clauses of that instrument. But, as it is immediately connected with the
subject before us, it seems expedient in this place to give it a deliberate
attention.

 <b>
  § 374.
 </b>
 In order to clear the question of all minor points, which might
embarrass us in the discussion, it is necessary to suggest a few
preliminary remarks. The constitution, contemplating the grant of limited
powers, and distributing them among various functionaries, and the state
governments, and their functionaries, being also clothed with limited
powers, subordinate to those granted to the general government, whenever
any question arises, as to the exercise of any power by any of these
functionaries under the state, or federal government, it is of necessity,
that such functionaries must, in the first instance, decide upon the
constitutionality of the exercise of such power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#2">
   2
  </a>
 </sup>
 It may arise in the
course of the discharge of the functions of any one, or of all, of the
great departments of government, the executive, the legislative, and the
judicial. The officers of each of these departments are equally bound by
their oaths of office to support the constitution of the United States, and
are therefore conscientiously bound to abstain from all acts, which are
inconsistent with it. Whenever, therefore, they are required to act in a
case, not hitherto settled by any proper authority, these functionaries
must, in the first instance, decide, each for himself, whether,
consistently with the constitution, the act can be done. If, for instance,
the president is required to do any act, he is not only authorized, but
required, to decide for himself, whether, consistently with his
constitutional duties, he can do the act.
 <sup>
  <a href="#3">
   3
  </a>
 </sup>
 So, if a proposition be be-
</p>
<p>
 fore congress, every member of the legislative body is bound to examine,
and decide for himself, whether the bill or resolution is within the
constitutional reach of the legislative powers confided to congress. And in
many cases the decisions of the executive and legislative departments, thus
made, become final and conclusive, being from their very nature and
character incapable of revision. Thus, in measures exclusively of a
political, legislative, or executive character, it is plain, that as the
supreme authority, as to these questions, belongs to the legislative and
executive departments, they cannot be re-examined elsewhere. Thus, congress
having the power to declare war, to levy taxes, to appropriate money, to
regulate intercourse and commerce with foreign nations, their mode of
executing these powers can never become the subject of reexamination in any
other tribunal. So the power to make treaties being confided to the
president and senate, when a treaty is properly ratified, it becomes the
law of the land, and no other tribunal can gainsay its stipulations. Yet
cases may readily be imagined, in which a tax may be laid, or a treaty
made, upon motives and grounds wholly beside the intention of the
constitution.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">
   4
  </a>
 </sup>
 The
</p>
<p>
 remedy, however, in such cases is solely by an appeal to the people at the
elections; or by the salutary power of amendment, provided by the
constitution itself.

 <b>
  § 375.
 </b>
 But, where the question is of a different nature, and
capable of
judicial inquiry and decision, there it admits of a very different
consideration. The decision then made, whether in favour, or against the
constitutionality of the act, by the state, or by the national authority,
by the legislature, or by the executive, being capable, in its own nature,
of being brought to the test of the constitution, is subject to judicial
revision. It is in such cases, as we conceive, that there is a final and
common arbiter provided by the constitution itself, to whose decisions all
others are subordinate; and that arbiter is the supreme judicial authority
of the courts of the Union.
 <sup>
  <a href="#6">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 376.
 </b>
 Let us examine the grounds, on which this doctrine is
maintained.
The constitution declares, (Art. 6,) that " This constitution, and the laws
of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all
treaties, &amp;c. shall be the supreme law of the
</p>
<p>
 land." It also declares, (Art. 3,) that " The judicial power shall extend
to all cases in law and equity, arising under this constitution, the laws
of the United States and treaties made, and which shall be made under their
authority." It further declares, ( Art. 3,) that the judicial power of the
United States " shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior
courts, as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish."
Here, then, we have express, and determinate provisions upon the very
subject. Nothing is imperfect, and nothing is left to implication. The
constitution is the supreme law; the judicial power extends to all cases
arising in law and equity under it; and the courts of the United States
are, and, in the last resort, the Supreme Court of the United States is, to
be vested with this judicial power. No man can doubt or deny, that the
power to construe the constitution is a judicial power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#7">
   7
  </a>
 </sup>
 The power to
construe a treaty is clearly so, when the case arises in judgment in a
controversy between individuals.
 <sup>
  <a href="#8">
   8
  </a>
 </sup>
 The like principle must apply, where
the meaning of the constitution arises in a judicial controversy; for it is
an appropriate function of the judiciary to construe laws.
 <sup>
  <a href="#9">
   9
  </a>
 </sup>
 If, then, a
case under the constitu-
</p>
<p>
 tion does arise, if it is capable of judicial examination and decision, we
see, that the very tribunal is appointed to make the decision. The only
point left open for controversy is, whether such decision, when made, is
conclusive and binding upon the states, and the people of the states. The
reasons, why it should be so deemed, will now be submitted.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 377.
 </b>
 In the first place, the judicial power of the United States
rightfully extending to all such cases, its judgment becomes ipso facto
conclusive between the parties before it, in respect to the points decided,
unless some mode be pointed out by the constitution, in which that judgment
may be revised. No such mode is pointed out. Congress is vested with ample
authority to provide for the exercise by the Supreme Court of appellate
jurisdiction from the decisions of all inferior tribunals, whether state or
national, in cases within the purview of the judicial power of the United
States; but no mode is provided, by which any superior tribunal can
re-examine, what the Supreme Court has itself decided. Ours is emphatically
a government of laws, and not of men; and judicial decisions of the highest
tribunal, by the known course of the common law, are considered, as
establishing the true construction of the laws, which are brought into
controversy before it. The case is not alone considered as decided and
settled; but the principles of the decision are held, as precedents and
authority, to bind future cases of the same nature. This is the constant
practice under our whole system of jurisprudence. Our ancestors brought it
with them, when they first emigrated to this country; and it is, and always
has been considered, as the great security of our rights, our liberties,
and our property. It is on this account, that our law is justly
</p>
<p>
 deemed certain, and founded in permanent principles, and not dependent upon
the caprice, or will of particular judges. A more alarming doctrine could
not be promulgated by any American court, than that it was at liberty to
disregard all former rules and decisions, and to decide for itself, without
reference to the settled course of antecedent principles.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 378.
 </b>
 This known course of proceeding, this settled habit of
thinking,
this conclusive effect of judicial adjudications, was in the full view of
the framers of the constitution. It was required, and enforced in every
state in the Union; and a departure from it would have been justly deemed
an approach to tyranny and arbitrary power, to the exercise of mete
discretion, and to the abandonment of all the just checks upon judicial
authority.  It would seem impossible, then, to presume, if the people
intended to introduce a new rule in respect to the decisions of the Supreme
Court, and to limit the nature and operations of their judgments in a
manner wholly unknown to the common law, and to our existing jurisprudence,
that some indication of that intention should not be apparent on the face
of the constitution. We find, (Art. 4,) that the constitution has declared,
that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the judicial
proceedings of every other state. But no like provision has been made in
respect to the judgments of the courts of the United States, because they
were plainly supposed to be of paramount and absolute obligation throughout
all the states. If the judgments of the Supreme Court upon constitutional
questions are conclusive and binding upon the citizens at large, must they
not be equally conclusive upon the states? If the states are parties to
that instrument, are not the people of the states also parties?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 379.
 </b>
 It has been=20said, "that however true it may be, that the
judicia=
l
department is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the
constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be
deemed the last in relation to the other departments of the government, not
in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact,
from which the judicial, as well as the other departments hold their
delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power
would annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this
department with the others in usurped powers might subvert for ever, and
beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very constitution,
which all were instituted to preserve."
 <sup>
  <a href="#10">
   10
  </a>
 </sup>
 Now, it is certainly possible,
that all the departments of a government may conspire to subvert the
constitution of that government, by which they are created. But if they
should so conspire, there would still remain an adequate remedy to redress
the evil. In the first place, the people, by the exercise of the elective
franchise, can easily check and remedy any dangerous, palpable, and
deliberate infraction of the constitution in two of the great departments
of government; and, in the third department, they can remove the judges, by
impeachment, for any corrupt conspiracies. Besides these ordinary remedies,
there is a still more extensive one, embodied in the form of the
constitution, by the power of amending it, which is always in the power of
three fourths of the states. It is a supposition not to be endured for a
moment, that three fourths of the states would conspire in any deliberate,
dangerous, and palpable breach of the constitution. And if the judicial
department alone should
</p>
<p>
 attempt any usurpation, congress, in its legislative capacity, has full
power to abrogate the injurious effects of such a decision. Practically
speaking, therefore, there can be very little danger of any such usurpation
or deliberate breach.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 380.
 </b>
 But it is always a doubtful mode of reasoning to argue from the
possible abuse of powers, that they do not exist.
 <sup>
  <a href="#11">
   11
  </a>
 </sup>
 Let us look for a
moment at the consequences, which flow from the doctrine on the other side.
There are now twenty-four states in the Union, and each has, in its
sovereign capacity, a right to decide for itself in the last resort, what
is the true construction of the constitution; what are its powers; and what
are the obligations founded on it. We may, then, have, in the free exercise
of that right, twentyfour honest, but different expositions of every power
in that constitution, and of every obligation involved in it. What one
state may deny, another may assert; what one may assert at one time, it may
deny at another time. This is not mere supposition. It has, in point of
fact, taken place. There never has been a single constitutional question
agitated, where different states, if they have expressed any opinion, have
not expressed different opinions; and there have been, and, from the
fluctuating nature of legislative bodies, it may be supposed? that there
will continue to be, cases, in which the same state will at different times
hold different opinions on the same question. Massachusetts at one time
thought the embargo of 1807 unconstitutional; at another a majority, from
the change of parties, was as decidedly the other way. Virginia, in 1810,
thought that the Supreme Court was the common
</p>
<p>
 arbiter; in 1829 she thought differently.
 <sup>
  <a href="#12">
   12
  </a>
 </sup>
 What, then, is to become of
the constitution, if its powers are thus perpetually to be the subject of
debate and controversy? What exposition is to be allowed to be of
authority? Is the exposition of one state to be of authority there, and the
reverse to be of authority in a neighbouring state, entertaining an
opposite exposition? Then, there would be at no time in the United States
the same constitution in operation over the whole people. Is a power, which
is doubted, or denied by a single state, to be suspended either wholly, or
in that state? Then, the constitution is practically gone, as a uniform
system, or indeed, as any system at all, at the pleasure of any state. If
the power to nullify the constitution exists in a single state, it may
rightfully exercise it at its pleasure. Would not this be a far more
dangerous and mischievous power, than a power granted by all the states to
the judiciary to construe the constitution? Would not a tribunal, appointed
under the authority of all, be more safe, than twenty-four tribunals acting
at their own pleasure, and upon no common principles and co-operation?
Suppose congress should declare war; shall one state have power to suspend
it? Suppose congress should make peace; shall one state have power to
involve the whole country in war? Suppose the president and senate should
make a treaty; shall one state declare it a nullity, or subject the whole
country to reprisals for refusing to obey it? Yet, if every state may for
itself judge of its obligations under the constitution, it may disobey a
particular law or treaty, because it may deem it an unconstitutional
exercise of power,
</p>
<p>
 although every other state shall concur in a contrary opinion. Suppose
congress should lay a tax upon imports burthensome to a particular state,
or for purposes, which such state deems unconstitutional, and yet all the
other states are in its favour; is the law laying the tax to become a
nullity?  That would be to allow one state to withdraw a power from the
Union, which was given by the people of all the states. That would be to
make the general government the servant of twentyfour masters, of different
wills and different purposes, and yet bound to obey them all.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 381.
 </b>
 The argument, therefore, arising from a possibility of an
abuse of
power, is, to say the least of it, quite as strong the other way. The
constitution is in quite as perilous a state from the power of overthrowing
it lodged in every state in the Union, as it can be by being lodged in any
department of the federal government. There is this difference, however, in
the cases, that if there be federal usurpation, it may be checked by the
people of all the states in a constitutional way. If there be usurpation by
a single state, it is, upon the theory we are considering, irremediable.
Other difficulties, however, attend the reasoning we are considering. When
it is said, that the decision of the Supreme Court in the last resort is
obligatory, and final "in relation to the authorities of the other
departments of the government," is it meant of the federal government only,
or of the states also? If of the former only, then the constitution is no
longer the supreme law of the land, although all the state functionaries
are bound by ah oath to support it. If of the latter also, then it is
obligatory upon the state
</p>
<p>
 legislatures, executives, and judiciaries. It binds them; and yet it does
not bind the people of the states, or the states in their sovereign
capacity. The states may maintain one construction of it, and the
functionaries of the state are bound by another. If, on the other hand, the
state functionaries are to follow the construction of the state, in
opposition to the construction of the Supreme Court, then the constitution,
as actually administered by the different functionaries, is different; and
the duties required of them may be opposite, and in collision with each
other. If such a state of things is the just result of the reasoning, may
it not justly be suspected, that the reasoning itself is unsound?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 382.
 </b>
 Again; it is a part of this argument, that the judicial
interpretation is not binding " inrelation to the rights of the parties to
the constitutional compact." "On any other hypothesis the delegation of
judicial power would annul the authority delegating it." Who then are the
parties to this contract?  Who did delegate the judicial power?  Let the
instrument answer for itself. The people of the United States are the
parties to the constitution. The people of the United States delegated the
judicial rower. It was not a delegation by the people of one state, but by
the people of all the states. Why then is not a judicial decision binding
in each state, until all, who delegated the power, in some constitutional
manner concur in annulling or overruling the decision? Where shall we find
the clause, which gives the power to each state to construe the
constitution for all; and thus of itself to supersede in its own favour the
construction of all the rest? Would not this be justly deemed a delegation
of judicial power, which would annul the authority
</p>
<p>
 delegating it?
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 Since the whole people of the United States have concurred
in establishing the constitution, it would seem most consonant with reason
to presume, in the absence of all contrary stipulations, that they did not
mean, that its obligatory force should depend upon the dictate or opinion
of any single state. Even under the confederation, (as has been already
stated,) it was unanimously resolved by congress, that "as state
legislatures are not competent to the making of such compacts or treaties,
[with foreign states,] so neither are they competent in that capacity
authoritatively to decide on, or ascertain the construction and sense of
them." And the reasoning, by which this opinion is supported, seems
absolutely unanswerable.
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
 If this was true under such an instrument, and
that construction was avowed before the whole American people, and brought
home to the knowledge of the state legislatures, how can we avoid the
inference, that under the constitution, where an express judicial power in
cases arising under the constitution was provided for, the people must have
understood and intended, that the states should have no right to question,
or control such judicial interpretation?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 383.
 </b>
 In the next place, as the judicial power extends to all cases
arising under the constitution, and that constitution is declared to be the
supreme law, that supremacy would naturally he construed to ex-
</p>
<p>
 tend, not only over the citizens, but over the states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#16">
   16
  </a>
 </sup>
 This, however, is
not left to implication, for it is declared to be the supreme law of the
land, "any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary
notwithstanding." The people of any state cannot, then, by any alteration
of their state constitution, destroy, or impair that supremacy. How, then,
can they do it in any other less direct manner? Now, it is the proper
function of the judicial department to interpret laws, and by the very
terms of the constitution to interpret the supreme law. Its interpretation,
then, becomes obligatory and conclusive upon all the departments of the
federal government, and upon the whole people, so far as their rights and
duties are derived from, or affected by that constitution. If then all the
departments of the national government may rightfully exercise all the
powers, which the judicial department has, by its interpretation, declared
to be granted by the constitution; and are prohibited from exercising
those, which are thus declared not to be granted by it, would it not be a
solecism to hold, notwithstanding, that such rightful exercise should not
be deemed the supreme law of the land, and such prohibited powers should
still be deemed granted? It would seem repugnant to the first notions of
justice, that in respect to the same instrument of government, different
powers, and duties, and obligations should arise, and different rules
should prevail, at the same time among the governed, from a right of
interpreting the same words (manifestly used in one sense only) in
different, nay, in opposite senses. If there ever was a case, in which
uniformity of interpretation might well be deemed a necessary postulate, it
</p>
<p>
 would seem to be that of a fundamental law of a government. It might
otherwise follow, that the same individual, as a magistrate, might be bound
by one rule, and in his private capacity by another, at the very same
moment.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 384.
 </b>
 There would be neither wisdom nor policy in such a
doctrine; and i=
t
would deliver over the constitution to interminable doubts, founded upon
the fluctuating opinions and characters of those, who should, from time to
time, be called to administer it. Such a constitution could, in no just
sense, be deemed a law, much less a supreme or fundamental law. It would
have none of the certainty or universality, which are the proper attributes
of such a sovereign rule. It would entail upon us all the miserable
servitude, which has been deprecated, as the result of vague and uncertain
jurisprudence. Misera est servitus, ubi jus est vagum aut incertum. It
would subject us to constant dissensions, and perhaps to civil broils, from
the perpetually recurring conflicts upon constitutional questions. On the
other hand, the worst, that could happen from a wrong decision of the
judicial department, would be, that it might require the interposition of
congress, or, in the last resort, of the amendatory power of the states, to
redress the grievance.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 385.
 </b>
 We find the power to construe the constitution expressly
confided
to the judicial department, without any limitation or qualification, as to
its conclusiveness. Who, then, is at liberty, by general implications, not
from the terms of the instrument, but from mere theory, and assumed
reservations of sovereign right, to insert such a limitation or
qualification? We find, that to produce uniformity of interpretation, and
to preserve the constitution, as a perpetual bond of
</p>
<p>
 union, a supreme arbiter or authority of construing is, if not absolutely
indispensable, at least, of the highest possible practical utility and
importance. Who, then, is at liberty to reason down the terms of the
constitution, so as to exclude their natural force and operation?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 386.
 </b>
 We find, that it is the known course of the judicial
department of
the several states to decide in the last resort upon all constitutional
questions arising in judgment; and that this has always been maintained as
a rightful exercise of authority, and conclusive upon the whole state.
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">
   17
  </a>
 </sup>
 As such, it has been constantly approved by the people, and never withdrawn
from the courts by any amendment of their constitutions, when the people
have been called to revise them. We find, that the people of the several
states have constantly relied upon this last judicial appeal, as the
bulwark of their state rights and liberties; and that it is in perfect
consonance with the whole structure of the jurisprudence of the common law.
Under such circumstances, is it not most natural to presume, that the same
rule was intended to be applied to the constitution of the United States?
And when we find, that the judicial department of the United States is
actually entrusted with a like power, is it not an irresistible
presumption, that it had the same object, and was to have the same
universally conclusive effect?  Even under the confederation, an instrument
framed with infinitely more jealousy and deference for state rights, the
judgments of the judicial department appointed to decide controversies
between states was declared to be final and conclusive; and the appellate
power in other
</p>
<p>
 cases was held to overrule all state decisions and state legislation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 387.
 </b>
 If, then, reasoning from the terms of the constitution, and the
known principles of our jurisprudence, the appropriate conclusion is, that
the judicial department of the United States is, in the last resort, the
final expositor of the constitution, as to all questions of a judicial
nature; let us see, in the next place, how far this reasoning acquires
confirmation from the past history of the constitution, and the practice
under it.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 388.
 </b>
 That this view of the constitution was taken by its framers and
friends, and was submitted to the people before its adoption, is positively
certain. The Federalist2 says, "Under the national government, treaties and
articles of treaties as well as the law of nations, will always be
expounded in one sense, and executed in the same manner; whereas,
adjudications on the same points and questions in thirteen states, or three
or four confederacies, will not always accord, or be consistent; and that
as well from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by
different and independent governments, as from the different local laws,
which may affect and influence them. The wisdom of the convention in
committing such questions to the jurisdiction and judgment of courts
appointed by, and responsible only to, one national government, cannot be
too much commended." Again, referring to the objection taken, that the
government was national, and not a confederacy of sovereign states, and
after stating, that the jurisdiction of the national government extended to
certain enumerated objects only, and left the resi-
</p>
<p>
 due to the several states, it proceeds to say:1  "It is true, that in
controversies between the two jurisdictions (state and national) the
tribunal, which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under the
general government. But this does not change the principle of the case. The
decision is to be impartially made according to the rules of the
constitution, and all the usual and most effectual precautions are taken to
secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is clearly essential to
prevent an appeal to the sword, and a dissolution of the compact. And that
it ought to be established under the general, rather than under the local
governments, or, to speak more properly, that it could be safely
established under the first alone, is a position not likely to be
combated."

 The subject is still more elaborately considered in another
number,
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
 which treats of the judicial department in relation to the
extent of its powers. It is there said, that there ought always to be a
constitutional method of giving efficacy to constitutional provisions; that
if there are such things as political axioms, the propriety of the judicial
department of a government being co-extensive with its legislature, may be
ranked among the number;
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
 that the mere necessity of uniformity in the
interpretation of the national law decides the question; that thirteen
independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes is a hydra of
government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed;
that controversies between the
</p>
<p>
 nation and its members can only, be properly referred to the national
tribunal; that the peace of the whole ought not to be left at the disposal
of a part; and that whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb the
harmony of the states, are proper objects of federal superintendence and
control.

 The same doctrine was constantly avowed in the state
conventions,

objection to the constitution; with others it was deemed vital to its ex-
</p>

 istence and value.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25

 So, that it is indisputable, that the constitution
was adopted under a full knowledge of this exposition of its grant of power
to the judicial department.

<p>
 <b>
  § 391.
 </b>
 This is not all. The constitution has now been in full
operation
more than forty years; and during this period the Supreme Court has
constantly exercised this power of final interpretation in relation, not
only to the constitution, and laws of the Union, but in relation to state
acts and state constitutions and laws, so far as they affected the
constitution, and laws, and treaties of the United States.
 <sup>
  <a href="#27">

 Their
decisions upon these grave questions have never been repudiated, or
impaired by congress.
 <sup>
  <a href="#28">

 No state has ever deliberately or forcibly
resisted the execution of the judgments founded upon

 them; and the highest state tribunals have, with scarcely a single
exception, acquiesced in, and, in most instances, assisted in executing
them.
 <sup>

 During the same period, eleven states have been admitted into the
Union, under a full persuasion, that the same power would be exerted over
them. Many of the states have, at different times within the same period,
been called upon to consider, and examine the grounds, on which the
doctrine has been maintained, at the solicitation of other states which
felt, that it operated injuriously, or might operate injuriously upon their
interests. A great majority of the states, which have been thus called upon
in their legislative capacities to express opinions, have maintained the
correctness of the doctrine, and the beneficial effects of the powers, as a
bond of union, in terms of the most unequivocal nature.

 Whenever any
</p>
<p>
 amendment has been proposed to change the tribunal, and substitute another
common umpire or interpreter, it has rarely received the concurrence of
more than two or three states, and has been uniformly rejected by a great
majority, either silently, or by an express dissent. And instances have
occurred, in which the legislature of the same state has, at different
times, avowed opposite opinions, approving at one time, what it had denied,
or at least questioned at another. So, that it may be asserted with entire
confidence, that for forty years three fourths of all the states composing
the Union have expressly assented to, or silently approved, this
construction of the constitution, and have resisted every effort to
restrict, or alter it. A weight of public opinion among the people for such
a period, uniformly thrown into one scale so strongly, and so decisively,
in the midst of all the extraordinary changes of parties, the events of
peace and of war, and the trying conflicts of public policy and state
interests, is perhaps unexampled in the history of all other free
governments.

 In this review of the power of the judicial department, upon a
question of its supremacy in the interpretation of the constitution, it has
not been thought
</p>
<p>
 necessary to rely on the deliberate judgments of that department in
affirmance of it. But it may be proper to add that the judicial department
has not only constantly exercised this right of interpretation in the last
resort; but its whole course of reasonings and operation has proceeded upon
the ground, that, once made, the interpretation was conclusive, as well
upon the states, as the people.

 But it may be asked, as it has been asked, what is to be the
remedy, if there be any misconstruction of the constitution on the part of
the government
</p>
<p>
 of the United States, or its functionaries, and any powers exercised by
them, not warranted by its true meaning? To this question a general answer
may be given
</p>
<p>
 in the worlds of its early expositors: "The same, as if the state
legislatures should violate their respective constitutional authorities."
In the first instance, if this should
</p>
<p>
 be by congress, " the success of the usurpation will depend on the
executive and judiciary departments, which are to expound, and give effect
to the legislative acts; and, in the last resort, a remedy must be obtained
from the people, who can, by the election of more faithful representatives,
annul the acts of the usurpers. The
</p>
<p>
 truth is, that this ultimate redress may be more confided in against
unconstitutional acts of the federal, than of the state legislatures, for
this plain reason, that, as every act of the former will be an invasion of
the rights of the latter, these will ever be ready to mark the innovation,
to sound the alarm to the people, and to exert their local influence in
effecting a change of federal representatives. There being no such
intermediate body between the state legislatures and the people, interested
in watching the conduct of the former, violations of the state constitution
are more likely to remain unnoticed and unredressed."

<p>
 <b>
  § 394.
 </b>
 In the next place, if the usurpation should be by the
president, an
adequate check may be generally found, not only in the elective franchise,
but also in the controlling power of congress, in its legislative or
impeaching capacity, and in an appeal to the judicial department. In the
next place, if the usurpation should be by the judiciary, and arise from
corrupt motives, the power of impeachment would remove the offenders; and
in most other cases the legislative and executive authorities could
interpose an efficient barrier. A declaratory or prohibitory law would, in
many cases, be a complete remedy. We have, also, so far at least as a
conscientious sense of the obligations of duty, sanctioned by an oath of
office, and an indissoluble responsibility to the people for the exercise
and abuse of power, on the part of different departments of the government,
can influence human minds, some additional guards against known and
deliberate usurpations; for both are provided for in the constitution
itself. "The wisdom and the discretion of congress, (it has been justly
observed,) their identity with the people,
</p>
<p>
 and the influence, which their constituents possess at elections, are, in
this, as in many other instances, as, for example, that of declaring, war;
the sole restraints; on this they have relied, to secure them from abuse.
They are the restraints, on which the people must often solely rely in all
representative governments."

  § 395.
 </b>
 But in the next place, (and it is that, which would
furnish a case
of most difficulty and danger, though it may fairly be presumed to be of
rare occurrence,) if the legislature, executive, and judicial departments
should all concur in a gross usurpation, there is still a peaceable remedy
provided by the constitution. It is by the power of amendment, which may
always be applied at the will of three fourths of the states. If,
therefore, there should be a corrupt co-operation of three fourths of the
states for permanent usurpation, (a case not to be supposed, or if
supposed, it differs not at all in principle or redress from the case of a
majority of a state or nation having the same intent,) the case is
certainly irremediable under any known forms of the constitution. The
states may now by a constitutional amendment, with few limitations, change
the whole structure and powers of the government, and thus legalize any
present excess of power. And the general right of a society in other cases
to change the government atthe will of a majority of the whole people, in
any manner, that may suit its pleasure, is undisputed, and seems
indisputable. If there be any remedy at all for the minority in such cases,
it is a remedy never provided for by human institutions. It is by a
</p>
<p>
 resort to the ultimate right of all human beings in extreme cases to resist
oppression, and to apply force against ruinous injustice.

 As a fit conclusion to this part of these commentaries,
we cannot
do better than to refer to a confirmatory view, which has been recently
presented to the public by one of the framers of the constitution, who is
now, it is believed, the only surviving member of the federal convention,
and who, by his early as well as his later labours, has entitled himself to
the gratitude of his country, as one of its truest patriots, and most
enlightened friends. Venerable, as he now is, from age and character, and
absolved from all those political connexions, which may influence the
judgment, and mislead the mind, he speaks from his retirement in a voice,
which cannot be disregarded, when it instructs us by its profound
reasoning, or admonishes us of our dangers by its searching appeals.
However particular passages may seem open to criticism, the general
structure of the argument stands on immovable foundations, and can scarcely
perish, but with the constitution, which it seeks to uphold.

<ol>
<li><a id="1"></a> The point was very strongly argued, and much considered, in the case of
Cohens v. Virginia, in the Supreme Court in 1821, (6 Wheat. R. 264.) The
whole argument, as well as the judgment, deserves an attentive reading. The
result, to which the argument against the existence of a common arbiter
leads, is presented in a very forcible manner by Mr. Chief Justice
Marshall, in pages 376, 377. " The questions presented to the court by the two first points made at the
bar are of great magnitude, and may be truly said vitally to affect the
Union. They exclude the inquiry, whether the constitution and laws of the
United States have been violated by the judgment, which the plaintiffs in
error seek to review; and maintain, that, admitting such violation, it is
not in the power of the government to apply a corrective. They maintain,
that the nation does not possess a department capable of restraining
peaceably, and by authority of law, any attempts, which maybe made by a
part against the legitimate powers of the whole; and that the government is
reduced to the alternative of submitting to such attempts, or of resisting
them by force. They maintain, that the constitution of the United States
has provided no tribunal for the final construction of itself, or of the
laws or treaties of the nation; but that this power may be exercised in the
last resort by the courts of every state in the Union. That the
constitution, laws, and treaties, may receive as many constructions, as
there are states; and that this is not a mischief, or, if a mischief, is
irremediable. These abstract propositions are to be determined; for he, who
demands decision without permitting inquiry, affirms, that the decision he
asks does not depend on inquiry.  "If such be the constitution, it is the duty of this court to bow with
respectful submission to its provisions. If such be not the constitution,
it is equally the duty of this court to say so; and to perform that task,
which the American people have assigned to the judicial department."</li>
<li><a id="2"></a> See the Federalist, No. 33.</li>
<li><a id="3"></a> Mr. Jefferson carries his doctrine much farther, and holds, that each  department of government has an exclusive right, independent of the
judiciary, to decide for itself, as to the true construction of the
constitution. " My construction," says he, " is very different from that,
you quote. It is, that each department of the government is truly
independent of the others, and has an equal right to decide for itself,
what is the meaning of the constitution in the laws submitted to its
action, and especially, when it is to act ultimately and without appeal."
And he proceeds to give examples, in which he disregarded, when president,
the decisions of the judiciary, and refers to the alien and sedition laws,
and the case of Marbury v. Madison, (1 Cranch, 137.) 4 Jefferson's Corresp.

1800, has gone into a consideration of this point, and very properly
suggested, that there may be infractions of the constitution not within the
reach of the judicial power, or capable of remedial redress through the
instrumentality of courts of law. But we cannot agree with him, that in
such cases, each state may take the construction of the constitution into
its own hands, and decide for itself in the last resort; much less, that in
a case of judicial cognizance, the decision is not binding on the states.

gratification to quote the following passage from the learned Commentaries
of Mr. Chancellor Kent, than whom very few judges in our country are more
profoundly versed in constitutional law.  After enumerating the judicial
powers in the constitution, he proceeds to observe: "The propriety and
fitness of these judicial powers seem  to result, as a necessary consequence, from the union of these states in
one national government, and they may be considered as requisite to its
existence. The judicial power in every government must be co-extensive with
the power of legislation. Were there no power to interpret, pronounce, and
execute the law, the government would either perish through its own
imbecility, as was the case with the old confederation, or other powers
must be assumed by the legislative body to the destruction ofliberty." 1

<li><a id="24"></a> In The Federalist, No. 78 and 82, the same course of reasoning is
pursued, and the final nature of the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court is largely insisted on. In the Convention of Connecticut, Mr.
Ellsworth (afterwards Chief Justice of the United States) used the
following language: "This constitution defines the extent of the powers of
the general government. If the general legislature should at any time
overleap their limits, the judicial department is the constitutional check.
If the United States go beyond their powers; if they make a law, which the
constitution does not authorize, it is void; and the judicial power, the
national judges, who, to secure their impartiality, are to be made
independent, will declare it void. On the other hand, if the states go
beyond their limits; if they make a law, which is a usurpation upon the
general government, the law is void, and upright and independent judges
will declare it. Still, however, if the United States and the individual
states will quarrel; if they want to fight, they may do it, and no frame of
government can possibly prevent it " In the debates in the South Carolina
legislature, when the subject of calling a convention to ratify or reject
the constitution was before them,* Mr. Charles Pinckney (one of the members
of the convention) avowed the doctrine in the strongest terms. " That a
supreme federal jurisdiction was indispensable," said he, "cannot be
denied. It is equally true, that in order to ensure the administration of
justice, it was necessary to give all the powers, original as well as
appellate, the constitution has enumerated. Without it we could not expect
a due observance of treaties; that the state judiciaries would confine
themselves within their proper sphere; or that a general sense of justice
would pervade the Union, &amp;c. That to ensure these, extensive authorities
were necessary; particularly so, were they in a tribunal, constituted as
this is, whose duty it would be, not only to decide all national questions,
which should arise within the Union; but to control and keep the state
judiciaries within their proper limits, whenever they should attempt to
interfere with the power." * Debates in 1788, printed by A. E. Miller, 1831, Charleston, p. 7.</li>
<li><a id="25"></a> It would occupy too much space to quote the passages at large. Take for
an instance, in the Virginia debates, Mr. Madison's remarks. " It may be a
misfortune, that in organizing any government, the explication of its
authority should be left to any of its co-ordinate branches. There is no
example in any country, where it is otherwise. There is no new policy in
submitting it to the judiciary of the United States." 2 Elliot's Debates,
390. See also Id. 380, 383, 395, 400, 404, 418. See also North Carolina
Debates, 3 Elliot's Debates, 125, 127, 128, 130, 133, 134, 139, 141, 142,
143; Pennsylvania Debates, 3 Elliot's Debates, 280, 313. Mr. Luther Martin,
in his letter to the Maryland Convention, said: " By the third article the
judicial power is vested in one Supreme Court, &amp;c. These courts, and these
only, will have a right to decide upon the laws of the United States, and
all questions arising upon their construction, &amp;c. Whether, therefore, any
laws, &amp;c. of congress, or acts of its president, &amp;c. are contrary to, or
warranted by the constitution, rests only with the judges, who are
appointed by congress to determine; by whose determinations every state is
bound." 3 Elliot's Debates, 44, 45; Yates's Minutes, &amp;c. See also The
=46ederalist, No. 78.</li>

<li><a id="28"></a> In the debate in the first congress organized under the constitution,
the same doctrine was openly avowed, as indeed it has constantly been by
the majority of congress at all subsequent periods. See 1 Lloyd's Debates,
219 to 599; 2 Lloyd's Debates, 284 to 327.</li>
<li><a id="29"></a> Chief Justice M'Kean, in Commonwealth v.Cobbett (3 Dall. 473,) seems to
have adopted a modified doctrine, and to have held, that the Supreme Court
was not the common arbiter; but if not, the only remedy was, not by a state
deciding for itself, as in case of a treaty between independent
governments, but by a constitutional amendment by the states. But see, on
the other hand, the opinion of Chief Justice Spencer, in Andrews v.
Montgomery, 19 Johns. R. 164.</li>
<li><a id="30"></a> Massachusetts, in her Resolve of February 12, 1799, (p. 57,) in answer
to the Resolutions of Virginia of 1798, declared, " that the decision of
all cases in law and equity, arising under the constitution of the United
States, and the construction of all laws made in pursuance thereof, are
exclusively vested by the people in the judicial courts of the United
States;" and " that the people in that solemn compact, which is declared to
be the supreme law of the land, have not constituted the state legislatures
the judges of the acts or measures of the federal government, but have
confided to them the power of proposing such amendments" &amp;c.; and "that by
this construction of the constitution, an amicable and dispassionate remedy
is pointed out for any evil, which experience may prove to exist, and the
peace and prosperity of the United States may be preserved without
interruption." See also Dane's App. =A744, p. 56; Id. 80. Mr. Webster's
Speech in the Senate, in 1830, contains an admirable exposition of the same
doctrines. Webster's Speeches, 410, 419, 420, 421. In June, 1821. the House
of Representatives of NewHampshire passed certain resolutions. (172 yeas to
9 nays,) drawn  up (as is understood) by one of her most distinguished statesmen, asserting
the same doctrines. Delaware, in January, 1831, and Connecticut and
Massachusetts held the same, in May, 1831.</li>
<li><a id="31"></a> Virginia and Kentucky denied the power in 1793 and 1800; Massachusetts,
Delaware, Rhode-Island, New-York, Connecticut, NewHampshire, and Vermont
disapproved of the Virginia resolutions, and passed counter resolutions.
(North American Review, October, 1830, p. 500.) No other state appears to
have approved the Virginia resolutions. (Ibid.) In 1810 Pennsylvania
proposed the appointment of another tribunal than the Supreme Court to
determine disputes between the general and state governments. Virginia, on
that occasion, affirmed, that the Supreme Court was the proper tribunal;
and in that opinion New-Hampshire, Vermont, North-Carolina, Maryland,
Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and New-Jersey concurred; and no one state
approved of the amendment (North American Review, October, 1830, p. 507 to
512; Dane's App. =A755, p. 67; 6 Wheat. R. 358, note.) Recently, in March,
1831, Pennsylvania has resolved, that the 25th section of the judiciary act
of 1789, ch. 20, which gives the Supreme Court appellate  jurisdiction from state courts on constitutional questions, is authorized
by the constitution, and sanctioned by experience, and also all other laws
empowering the federal judiciary to maintain the supreme laws.</li>
<li><a id="32"></a> Upon this subject the speech of Mr. Webster in the Senate, in 1830,
presents the whole argument in a very condensed and powerful form. The
following passage is selected, as peculiarly appropriate: "The people,
then, sir, erected this government. They gave it a constitution, and in
that constitution they have enumerated the powers which they bestow on it.
They have made it a limited government. They have defined its authority.
They have restrained it to the exercise of such powers, as are granted; and
all others, they declare, are reserved to the states, or the people. But,
sir, they have not stopped here. If they had, they would have accomplished
but half their work. No definition can be so clear, as to avoid possibility
of doubt; no limitation so precise, as to exclude all uncertainty. Who,
then, shall construe this grant of the people? Who shall interpret their
will, where it may be supposed they have left it doubtful? With whom do
they repose this ultimate right of deciding on the powers of the
government? Sir, they have settled all this in the fullest manner. They
have left it, with the government itself, in its appropriate branches. Sir,
the very chief end, the main design, for which the whole constitution was
framed and adopted, was to establish a government, that should not be
obliged to act through state agency, or depend on state opinion and state
discretion. The people had had quite enough of that kind of government,
under the confederacy. Under that system, the legal action--the application
of law to individuals, belonged exclusively to the states. Congress could
only recommend--their acts were not of binding force, till the states had
adopted and sanctioned them. Are we in that condition still? Are we yet at
the mercy of state discretion, and state construction? Sir, if we are, then
vain will be our attempt to maintain the constitution, under which we sit. "But, sir, the people have wisely provided, in the constitution itself, a
proper, suitable mode and tribunal for settling questions of constitutional
law. There are, in the constitution, grants of powers to Congress; and
restrictions on these powers. There are, also, prohibitions on the states.
Some authority must, therefore, necessarily exist, having the ultimate  jurisdiction to fix and ascertain the interpretation of these grants,
restrictions, and prohibitions. The constitution has itself pointed out,
ordained, and established that authority. How has it accomplished this
great and essential end? By declaring, sir, that ' the constitution and the
law of the United States, made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme
law  of the land, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the
contrary notwithstanding.' "This, sir, was the first great step. By this, the supremacy of the
constitution and laws of the United States is declared. The people so will
it. No state law is to be valid, which comes in conflict with the
constitution, or any law of the United States passed in pursuance of it.
But who shall decide this question of interference? To whom lies the last
appeal? This, sir, the constitution itself decides, also, by declaring,
'that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under the
constitution and laws of the United States.' These two provisions, sir,
cover the whole ground. They are, in truth, the keystone of the arch. With
these, it is a constitution; without them, it is a confederacy. In
pursuance of these clear and express provisions, congress established, at
its very first session, in the judicial act, a mode for carrying them into
full effect, and for bringing all questions of constitutional power to the
final decision of the Supreme Court. It then, sir, became a government. It
then had the means of self-protection; and, but for this, it would, in all
probability, have been now among things, which are past. Having constituted
the government, and declared its powers, the people have further said, that
since somebody must decide on the extent of these powers, the government
shall itself decide; subject, always, like other popular governments, to
its responsibility to the people. And now, sir, I repeat, how is it, that a
state legislature acquires any power to interfere? Who, or what, gives them
the right to say to the people, ' We, who are your agents and servants for
one purpose, will undertake to decide, that your other agents and servants,
appointed by you for another purpose, have transcended the authority you
gave them !' The reply would be, I think, not impertinent--' Who made you a
judge over another's servants? To their own masters they stand or fall.' "Sir, I deny this power of state legislatures altogether. It cannot stand
the test of examination. Gentlemen may say, that in an extreme case, a
state government might protect the people from intolerable oppression. Sir,
in such a case, the people might protect themselves, without the aid of the
state governments. Such a case warrants revolution. It must make, when it
comes, a law for itself. A nullifying act of a state legislature cannot
alter the case, nor make resistance any more lawful.  In maintaining these sentiments, sir, I am but asserting the rights of the
people. I state what they have declared, and insist on their right to
declare it. They have chosen to repose this power in the general
government, and I think it my duty to support it, like other constitutional
powers." See also 1 Wilson's Law Lectures, 461, 462.--It is truly surprising, that
Mr. Vice-President Calhoun, in his Letter of the 28th of August, 1832, to
governor Hamilton, (published while the present work was passing through
the press,) should have thought, that a proposition merely offered in the
convention, and referred to a committee for their consideration, that " the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall be extended to all controversies
between the United States and an individual state, or the United States and
the citizens of an individual state,"* should, in connexion with others
giving a negative on state laws, establish the conclusion, that the
convention, which framed the constitution, was opposed to granting the
power to the general government, in any form, to exercise any control
whatever over a state by force, veto, or judicial process, or in any other
form. This clause for conferring jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in
controversies between the United States and the states, must, like the
other controversies between states, or between individuals, referred to the
judicial power, have been intended to apply exclusively to suits of a civil
nature, respecting property, debts contracts, or other claims by the United
States against a state; and not to the decision of constitutional questions
in the abstract. At a subsequent period of the convention, the judicial
power was expressly extended to all cases arising under the constitution,
laws, and treaties, of the United States, and to all controversies, to
which the United States should be a party,# thus covering the whole ground
of a right to decide constitutional questions of a judicial nature. And
this, as the Federalist informs us, was the substitute for a negative upon
state laws, and the only one, which was deemed safe or efficient. The

insane, or so wicked, as to seek the destruction of the government, they
may accomplish their object by refusing to perform the functions assigned
to them. " We readily concur with the counsel for the defendant in the declaration,
that the cases, which have been put, of direct legislative resistance for
the purpose of oppose the acknowledged powers of the government, are
extreme cases, and in the hope, that they will never occur; capacity of the
government to protect itself and its laws in such cases, would contribute
in no inconsiderable degree to their occurrence. "Let it be admitted, that the cases, which have been put, are extreme and
improbable, yet there are gradations of opposition to the laws, far short
of those cases, which might have a baneful influence on the affairs of the
nation. Different states may entertain different opinions on the true
construction of the constitutional powers of congress. We know, that at one
time, the assumption of the debts, contracted by the several states during
the war of our revolution, was deemed unconstitutional by some of them. We
know, too, that at other times, certain taxes, imposed by congress, have
been pronounced unconstitutional. Other laws have been questioned
partially, while they were supported by the great majority of the American
people. We have no assurance, that we shall be less divided, than we have
been. States may legislate in conformity to their opinions, and may enforce
those opinions by penalties. It would be hazarding too much to assert, that
the judicatures of the states will be exempt from the prejudices, by which
the legislatures and people are influenced, and will constitute perfectly
impartial tribunal. In many states the judges are dependent for office and
for salary on the will of the legislature. The constitution of the United
States furnishes no security against the universal adoption of this
principle. When we observe the importance, which that constitution attaches
to the independence of judges, we are the less inclined to suppose, that it
can have intended to leave these constitutional questions to tribunals,
where this independence may not exist, in all cases where a state shall
prosecute an individual, who claims the protection of an act of congress.
These prosecutions may take place, even without a legislative act. A
person, making a seizure under an act of congress, may be indicted as a
trespasser, if force has been employed, and of this a jury may judge. How
extensive may be the mischief, if the first decisions in such cases should
be final! "These collisions may take place in times of no extraordinary com-  motion. But a constitution is framed for ages to come, and is designed to
approach immortality, as nearly as human institutions can approach it. Its
course cannot always be tranquil. It is exposed to storms and tempests, and
its framers must be unwise statesmen indeed, if they have not provided it,
as far as its nature will permit, with the means of selfpreservation from
the perils it may be destined to encounter. No government ought to be so
defective in its organization, as not to contain within itself the means of
securing the execution of its own laws against other dangers, than those
which occur every day. Courts of justice are the means most usually
employed; and it is reasonable to expect, that a government should repose
on its own courts, rather than on others. There is certainly nothing in the
circumstances, under which our constitution was formed; nothing in the histo
ry of the times, which would justify the opinion, that the confidence
reposed in the states was so implicit, as to leave in them and their
tribunals the power of resisting or defeating, in the form of law, the
legitimate measures of the Union. The requisitions of congress, under the
confederation, were as constitutionally obligatory, as the laws enacted by
the present congress. That they were habitually disregarded, is a fact of
universal notoriety. With the knowledge of this fact, and under its full
pressure, a convention was assembled to change the system. Is it so
improbable, that they should confer on the judicial department the power of
construing the constitution and laws of the Union in every case, in the
last resort, and of preserving them from all violation from every quarter,
so far as judicial decisions can preserve them, that this improbability
should essentially affect the construction of the new system? We are told,
and we are truly told, that the great change, which is to give efficacy to
the present system, is its ability to act on individuals directly, instead
of acting through the instrumentality of state governments. But, ought not
this ability, in reason and sound policy, to he applied directly to the
protection of individuals employed in the execution of the laws, as well as
to their coercion? Your laws reach the individual without the aid of any
other power; why may they not protect him from punishment for performing
his duty in executing them? "The counsel for Virginia endeavour to obviate the force of these
arguments by saying, that the dangers they suggest, if not imaginary, are
inevitable; that the constitution can make no provision against them; and
that, therefore, in construing that instrument, they ought to be excluded
from our consideration. This state of things, they say, cannot arise, until
there shall be a disposition so hostile to the present political system, as
to produce a determination to destroy it; and, when that de-  termination shall be produced, its effects will not be restrained by
parchment stipulations. The fate of the constitution will not then depend
on judicial decisions. But, should no appeal be made to force, the states
can put an end to the government by refusing to act. They have only not to
elect senators, and it expires without a struggle. "It is very true, that, whenever hostility to the existing system shall
become universal, it will be also irresistible. The people made the
constitution, and the people can unmake it. It is the creature of their
will, and lives only by their will. But this supreme and irresistible power
to make, or to unmake, resides only in the whole body of the people; not in
any sub-division of them. The attempt of any of the parts to exercise. it
is usurpation, and ought to be repelled by those, to whom the people have
delegated their power of repelling it. "The acknowledged inability of the government, then, to sustain itself
against the public will, and, by force or otherwise, to control the whole
nation, is no sound argument in support of its constitutional inability to
preserve itself against a section of the nation acting in opposition to the
general will. "It is true, that if all the states, or a majority of them, refuse to
elect senators, the legislative powers of the Union will be suspended. But
if any one state shall refuse to elect them, the senate will not, on that
account, be the less capable of performing all its functions. The argument
founded on this fact would seem rather to prove the subordination of the
parts to the whole, than the complete independence of any one of them. The
framers of the constitution were, indeed, unable to make any provisions,
which should protect that instrument against a general combination of the
states, or of the people, for its destruction; and, conscious of this
inability, they have not made the attempt. But they were able to provide
against the operation of measures adopted in any one state, whose tendency
might be to arrest the execution of the laws, and this it was the part of
true wisdom to attempt. We think they have attempted it." See also M'Culloch v. Maryland, (4 Wheat. 316, 405, 406.) See also the

<li><a id="37"></a> Reference is here made to Mr. Madison's Letter, dated August, 1830, to
Mr. Edward Everett, published in the North American Review for October,
1830. The following extract is taken from p. 537, et seq. " In order to understand the true character of the constitution of the
United States, the error, not uncommon, must be avoided, of viewing it
through the medium, either of a consolidates government, or of a
confederated government, whilst it is neither the one, nor the other; but a
mixture of both. And having, in no model, the similitudes and analogies
applicable to other systems of government, it must, more than any other, be
its own interpreter according to its text and the facts of the case. " From these it will be seen, that the characteristic peculiarities of the
constitution are, 1, the mode of its formation; 2, the division of the
supreme powers of government between the states in their united capacity,
and the states in their individual capacities.  " 1. It was formed, not by the governments of the component states, as the
federal government, for which it was substituted was formed. Nor was it
formed by a majority of the people of the United States, as a single
community, in the manner of a consolidated government.
   
    " It was formed by the states, that is, by the people in each of the
states, acting in their highest sovereign capacity; and formed
consequently, by the same authority, which formed the state constitutions. " Being thus derived from the same source as the constitutions of the
states, it has, within each state, the same authority, as the constitution
of the state; and is as much a constitution, in the strict sense of the
term, within its prescribed sphere, as the constitutions of the states are,
within their respective spheres: but with this obvious and essential
difference, that being a compact among the states in their highest
sovereign capacity, and constituting the people thereof one people for
certain purposes, it cannot be altered, or annulled at the will of the
states individually, as the constitution of a state may. be at its
individual will. " 2. And that it divides the supreme powers of government, between the
government of the United States, and the governments of the individual
states; is stamped on the face of the instrument; the powers of war and of
taxation, of commerce and of treaties, and other enumerated powers vested
in the government of the United States, being of as high and sovereign a
character, as any of the powers reserved to the state governments. "Nor is the government of the United States, created by the constitution,
less a government in the strict sense of the term, within the sphere of its
powers, than the governments created by the constitutions of the states
are, within their several spheres. It is, like them, organized into
legislative, executive, and judiciary departments. It operates, like them,
directly on persons and things. And, like them, it has at command a
physical force for executing the powers committed to it. The concurrent
operation in certain cases is one of the features marking the peculiarity
of the system. "Between these different constitutional governments, the one operating in
all the states, the others operating separately in each, with the aggregate
powers of government divided between them, it could not escape attention,
that controversies would arise concerning the boundaries of jurisdiction;
and that some provision ought to be made for such occurrences.  A political
system, that does not provide for a peaceable and authoritative termination
of occurring controversies, would not be more than the shadow of a
government; the object and end of a real government being, the substitution
of law and order for uncertainty, confusion, and violence. "That to have left a final decision, in such cases, to each of the states,
then thirteen, and already twenty-four, could not fail to make the
constitution and laws of the United States different in different states,
was obvious; and not less obvious, that this diversity of indepen-  dent decisions must altogether distract the government of the union, and
speedily put an end to the union itself. A uniform authority of the laws,
is in itself a vital principle. Some of the most important laws could not
be partially executed. They must be executed in all the states, or they
could be duly executed in none. An impost, or an excise, for example, if
not in force in some states, would be defeated in others. It is well known,
that this was among the lessons of experience, which had a primary
influence in bringing about the existing constitution. A loss of its
general authority would moreover revive the exasperating questions between
the states holding ports for foreign commerce, and the adjoining states
without them; to which are now added, all the inland states, necessarily
carrying on their foreign commerce through other states
   
    "To have made the decisions under the authority of the individual states,
co-ordinate, in all cases, with decisions under the authority of the United
States, would unavoidably produce collisions incompatible with the peace of
society, and with that regular and efficient administration, which is of
the essence of free governments. Scenes could not be avoided, in which a
ministerial officer of the United States, and the correspondent officer of
an individual state, would have rencounters in executing conflicting
decrees; the result of which would depend on the comparative force of the
local posses attending them; and that, a casualty depending on the
political opinions and party feelings in different states. "To have referred every clashing decision, under the two authorities, for
a final decision, to the states as parties to the constitution, would be
attended with delays, with inconveniences, and with expenses, amounting to
a prohibition of the expedient; not to mention its tendency to impair the
salutary veneration for a system requiring such frequent inter positions,
nor the delicate questions, which might present themselves as to the form
of stating the appeal, and as to the quorum for deciding it. "To have trusted to negotiation for adjusting disputes between the governme
nt of the United States and the state governments, as between independent
and separate sovereignties, would have lost sight altogether of a
constitution and government for the Union; and opened a direct road from a
failure of that resort, to the ultima ratio between nations wholly
independent of, and alien to each other. If the idea had its origin in the
process of adjustment between separate branches of the same government, the
analogy entirely fails. In the case of disputes between independent parts
of the same government, neither part being able to consummate its will, nor
the government to proceed without a concurrence of the parts, necessity
brings about an accommodation. In disputes between a state government, and
the government of the United States, the case is practically, as well as
theoretically different; each party possessing all the departments of an
organized government, legislative, executive, and judiciary; and having
each a physical force to support.  its pretensions.  Although the issue of negotiation might sometimes avoid
this extremity, how often would it happen among so many states, that an
unaccommodating spirit in some would render that resource unavailing? A
contrary supposition would not accord with a knowledge of human nature, or
the evidence of our own political history.
   
    "The constitution, not relying on any of the preceding modifications, for
its safe and successful operation, has expressly declared, on the one hand,
1, 'that the constitution, and the laws made in pursuance thereof,
and all treaties made under the authority of the United States shall be the
supreme law of the land; 2, that the judges of every state shall be bound
thereby, any thing in the constitution and laws of any state to the
contrary notwithstanding; 3, that the judicial power of the United States
shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution,
the laws of the United States, and treaties made under their
authority, &amp;c.' "On the other hand, as a security of the rights and powers of the states,
in their individual capacities, against an undue preponderance of the
powers granted to the government over them in their united capacity, the
constitution has relied on, (1,) the responsibility of the senators and
representatives in the legislature of the United States to the legislatures
and people of the states; (2,) the responsibility of the president to the
people of the United States; and ( 3,) the liability of the executive and
judicial functionaries of the United States to impeachment by the
representatives of the people of the states, in one branch of the
legislature of the United States, and trial by the representatives of the
states, in the other branch: the state functionaries, legislative,
executive, and judicial, being, at the same time, in their appointment and
responsibility, altogether independent of the agency or authority of the
United States. "How far this structure of the government of the United States is adequate
and safe for its objects, time alone can absolutely determine. Experience
seems to have shewn, that whatever may grow out of future stages of our
national career, there is, as yet, a sufficient control, in the popular
will, over the executive and legislative departments of the government.
When the alien and sedition laws were passed, in contravention to the
opinions and feelings of the community, the first elections, that ensued,
put an end to them. And whatever may have been the character of other acts,
in the judgment of many of us it is but true, that they have generally
accorded with the views of the majority of the states and of the people. At
the present day it seems well understood, that the laws,
which have created most dissatisfaction, have had a like sanction without
doors: and that, whether continued, varied, or repealed, a like proof will
be given of the sympathy and responsibility of the representative body to
the constituent body. Indeed, the great complaint now is, against the
results of this sympathy and responsibility in the legislative policy of
the nation.  "With respect to the judicial power of the United States, and the
authority of the Supreme Court in relation to the boundary of jurisdiction
between the federal and the state governments, I may be permitted to refer
to the thirty-ninth number of the Federalist for the light, in which the
subject was regarded by its writer at the period, when the constitution was
depending; and it is believed, that the same was the prevailing view then
taken of it; that the same view has continued to prevail; and that it does
so at this time, notwithstanding the eminent exceptions to it.
   
    "But it is perfectly consistent with the concession of this power to the
Supreme Court, in cases falling within the course of its functions, to
maintain, that the power has not always been rightly exercised. To say
nothing of the period, happily a short one, when judges in their seats did
not abstain from intemperate and party harangues, equally at variance with
their duty and their dignity; there have been occasional decisions from the
bench, which have incurred serious and extensive disapprobation. Still it
would seem, that, with but few exceptions, the course of the judiciary has
been hitherto sustained by the prominent sense of the nation. "Those who have denied, or doubted the supremacy of the judicial power of
the United States, and denounce at the same time a nullifying power in a
state, seem not to have sufficiently adverted to the utter inefficiency of
a supremacy in a law of the land, without a supremacy in the exposition and
execution of the law: nor to the destruction of all equipoise between the
federal government and the state governments, if, whilst the functionaries
of the federal government are directly or indirectly elected by, and
responsible to the states, and the functionaries of the states are in their
appointment and responsibility wholly independent of the United States, no
constitutional control of any sort belonged to the United States over the
states. Under such an organization, it is evident, that it would be in the
power of the states, individually, to pass unauthorized laws, and to carry
them into complete effect, any thing in the constitution and laws of the
United States to the contrary notwithstanding. This would be a nullifying
power in its plenary character; and whether it had its final effect,
through the legislative, executive, or judiciary organ of the state, would
be equally fatal to the constituted relation between the two governments. "Should the provisions of the constitution as here reviewed, be found not
to secure the government and rights of the states, against usurpations and
abuses on the part of the United States, the final resort within the
purview of the constitution, lies in an amendment of the constitution,
according to a process applicable by the states. "And in the event of a failure of every constitutional resort, and an
accumulation of usurpations and abuses, rendering passive obedience and
non-resistance a greater evil, than resistance and revolution, there can
remain but one resort, the last of all; an appeal from the can-  celled obligations of the constitutional compact, to original rights and
the law of self-preservation. This is the ultima ratio under all
governments, whether consolidated, confederated, or a compound of both; and
it cannot be doubted, that a single member of the Union, in the extremity
supposed, but in that only, would have a right, as an extra and ultra
constitutional right, to make the appeal.
   
    "This brings us to the expedient lately advanced, which claims for a
single state a right to appeal against an exercise of power by the
government of the United States, decided by the state to be
unconstitutional, to the parties to the constitutional compact; the
decision of the state to have the effect of nullifying the act of the
government ofthe United States, unless the decision of the state be
reversed by three fourths of the parties. "The distinguished names and high authorities, which appear to have
asserted, and given a practical scope to this doctrine, entitle it to a
respect, which it might be difficult otherwise to feel for it. "If the doctrine were to be understood as requiring the three fourths of
the states to sustain, instead of that proportion to reverse the decision
of the appealing state, the decision to be without effect during the
appeal, it would be sufficient to remark, that this extra-constitutional
course might well give way to that marked out by the constitution, which
authorizes two thirds of the states to institute, and three fourths to
effectuate an amendment of the constitution, establishing a permanent rule
of the highest authority, in place of an irregular precedent of
construction only. "But it is understood, that the nullifying doctrine imports, that the
decision of the state is to be presumed valid, and that it overrules the
law of the United States, unless overruled by three fourths of the states. "Can more be necessary to demonstrate the inadmissibility of such a
doctrine, than, that it puts it in the power of the smallest fraction over
one fourth of the United States, that is, of seven states out of
twentyfour, to give the law, and even the constitution to seventeen states,
each of the seventeen having, as parties to the constitution, an equal
right with each of the seven, to expound it, and to insist on the
exposition? That the seven might, in particular instances be right, and the
seventeen wrong, is more than possible. But to establish a positive and
permanent rule giving such a power, to such a minority, over such a
majority, would overturn the first principle of free government, and in
practice necessarily overturn the government itself. "It is to be recollected, that the constitution was proposed to the people
of the states as a whole, and unanimously adopted by the states as a whole,
it being a part of the constitution, that not less than three fourths of
the states should be competent to make any alteration in what had been
unanimously agreed to. So great is the caution on this point, that in two
cases where peculiar interests were at stake, a proportion even  of three fourths is distrusted, and unanimity required to make an alteration.
   
    "When the constitution was adopted as a whole, it is certain, that there
were many parts, which, if separately proposed, would have been promptly
rejected. It is far from impossible, that every part of a constitution
might be rejected by a majority, and yet taken together as a whole, be
unanimously accepted. Free constitutions will rarely, if ever, be formed,
without reciprocal concessions; without articles conditioned on, and
balancing each other. Is there a constitution of a single state out of the
twenty-four, that would bear the experiment of having its component parts
submitted to the people, and separately decided on? "What the fate of the constitution of the United States would be, if a
small proportion of the states could expunge parts of it particularly
valued by a large majority, can have but one answer. "The difficulty is not removed by limiting the doctrine to cases of
construction. How many cases of that sort, involving cardinal provisions of
the constitution, have occurred? How many now exist? How many may hereafter
spring up? How many might be ingeniously created, if entitled to the
privilege of a decision in the mode proposed? "Is it certain, that the principle of that mode would not reach further
than is contemplated? If a single state can, of right, require three
fourths of its co-states to overrule its exposition of the constitution,
because that proportion is authorized to amend it, would the plea be less
plausible, that, as the constitution was unanimously established, it ought
to be unanimously expounded? "The reply to all such suggestions, seems to be unavoidable and
irresistible; that the constitution is a compact; that its text is to be
expounded, according to the provisions for expounding it--making a part of
the compact; and that none of the parties can rightfully renounce the
expounding provision more than any other part. When such a right accrues,
as may accrue, it must grow out of abuses of the compact releasing the
sufferers from their fealty to it."</li>
