They
have declared it the supreme law of the land. They have made it a limited
government. They have defined its authority. They have restrained it to the
exercise of certain powers, and reserved all others to the states or to the
people. It is a popular government. Those who administer it are responsible to
the people. It is as popular, and Just as much emanating from the people, as the
state governments. It is created for one purpose; the state governments for
another. It may be altered, and amended, and abolished at the will of the
people. In short, it was made by the people, made for the people, and is
responsible to the people.

In this view of the matter, let us
now proceed to consider the rules, by which it ought to be interpreted; for, if
these rules are correctly laid down, it will save us from many embarrassments in
examining and defining its powers. Much of the difficulty, which has arisen in
all the public discussions on this subject, has had its origin in the want of
some uniform rules of interpretation, expressly or tacitly agreed on by the
disputants. Very different doctrines on this point have been adopted by
different commentators; and not unfrequently very different language held by the
same parties at different periods. In short, the rules of interpretation have
often been shifted to suit the emergency; and the passions and prejudices of the
day, or the favour and odium of a particular measure, have not unfrequently
furnished a mode of argument, which would, on the one hand, leave the
constitution crippled and inanimate, or, on other hand, give it an extent and
elasticity, subversive of all rational boundaries.

<p>
<a id="0399">

§ 399.
</b>
Let us, then, endeavour to
ascertain, what are the true rules of interpretation applicable to the
constitution; so that we may have some fixed standard, by which to measure its
powers, and limit its prohibitions, and guard its obligations, and enforce its
securities of our rights and liberties.

I. The first and fundamental rule in
the interpretation of all instruments is, to construe them according to the
sense of the terms, and the intention of the parties. Mr. Justice Blackstone has
remarked, that the intention of a law is to be gathered from the words, the
context, the subject-matter, the effects and consequence, or the reason and
spirit of the law.


<a href="#003">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
He goes on to
justify the remark by stating, that words are generally to be understood in
their usual and most known signification, not so much regarding the propriety of
grammar, as their general and popular use; that if words happen to be dubious,
their meaning may be established by the context, or by comparing them with other
words and sentences in the same instrument; that illustrations may be further
derived from the subject-matter, with reference to which the expressions are
used; that the effect and consequence of a particular construction is to be
examined, because, if a literal meaning would involve a manifest absurdity, it
ought not to be adopted; and that the reason and spirit of the law, or the
causes, which led to its enactment, are often the best exponents of the words,
and limit their application.

§ 401.
</b>
Where the words are plain and clear,
and the sense distinct and perfect arising on them, there is generally no
necessity to have recourse to other means of interpretation. It is only, when
there is some ambiguity or doubt arising from other sources, that interpretation
has its proper office. There may be obscurity, as to the meaning, from the
doubtful character of the words used, from other clauses in the same instrument,
or from an incongruity or repugnancy between the words, and the apparent
intention derived from the whole structure of the instrument, or its avowed
object. In all such cases interpretation becomes indispensable.

has divided interpretation into three kinds, literal, rational, and mixed. The
first is, where we collect the intention of the party from his words only, as
they lie before us. The second is, where his words do not express that intention
perfectly, but exceed it, or fall short of it, and we are to collect it from
probable or rational conjectures only. The third is, where the words, though
they do express the intention, when they are rightly understood, are themselves
of doubtful meaning, and we are bound to have recourse to the like conjectures
to find out in what sense they are used. In literal interpretation the rule
observed is, to follow that sense in respect both of the words, and of the
construction of them, which is agreeable to common use, without attending to
etymological fancies or grammatical refinements. In mixed interpretation, which
supposes the words to admit of two or more senses, each of which is agreeable to
common usage, we are obliged to collect the sense, partly from the words, and
partly from conjecture of the intention. The rules then adopted are, to construe
the words according to the subject matter, in such a sense as to produce a
reasonable effect, and with reference to the circumstances of the particular
transaction. Light may also be obtained in such cases from contemporary facts,
or expositions, from antecedent mischiefs, from known habits, manners, and
institutions, and from other sources almost innumerable, which may justly affect
the judgment in drawing a fit conclusion in the particular case.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0403">
</a>
<b>
§ 403.
</b>
Interpretation also may be strict or
large; though we do not always mean the same thing, when we speak of a strict or
large interpretation. When common usage has given two senses to the same word,
one of which is more confined, or includes fewer particulars than the other, the
former is called its strict sense, and the latter, which is more comprehensive
or includes more particulars, is called its large sense. If we find such a word
in a law, and we take it in its more confined sense, we are said to interpret it
strictly. If we take it in its more comprehensive sense, we are said to
interpret it largely. But whether we do the one or the other, we still keep to
the letter of the law. But strict and large interpretation are frequently
opposed to each other in a different sense. The words of a law may sometimes
express the meaning of the legislator imperfectly. They may, in their common
acceptation, include either more or less than his intention. And as, on the one
hand, we call it a strict interpretation, where we contend, that the letter is
to be adhered to precisely; so, on the other hand, we call it a large
interpretation, where we contend, that the words ought to be taken in such a
sense, as common usage will not fully justify; or that the meaning of the
legislator is something different from what his words in any usage would import.
In this sense a large interpretation is synonymous with what has before been
called a rational interpretation. And a strict interpretation, in this sense,
includes both literal and mixed interpretation; and may, as contradistinguished
from the former, be called a close, in opposition to a free or liberal
interpretation.

a closer practical application, when we arrive at more definite rules.

§ 405.

II. In construing the constitution
of the United States, we are, in the first instance, to consider, what are its
nature and objects, its scope and design, as apparent from the structure of the
instrument, viewed as a whole, and also viewed in its component parts. Where its
words are plain, clear, and determinate, they require no interpretation; and it
should, therefore, be admitted, if at all, with great caution, and only from
necessity, either to escape some absurd consequence, or to guard against some
fatal evil. Where the words admit of two senses, each of which is conformable to
common usage, that sense is to be adopted, which, without departing from the
literal import of the words, best harmonizes with the nature and objects, the
scope and design of the instrument. Where the words are unambiguous, but the
provision may cover more or less ground according to the intention, which is yet
subject to conjecture; or where it may include in its general terms more or
less, than might seem dictated by the general design, as that may be gathered
from other parts of the instrument, there is much more room for controversy; and
the argument from inconvenience will probably have different influences upon
different minds. Whenever such questions arise, they will probably be settled,
each upon its own peculiar grounds; and whenever it is a question of power, it
should be approached with infinite caution, and affirmed only upon the most
persuasive reasons. In examining the constitution, the antecedent situation of
the country, and its institutions, the existence and operations of the state
governments, the powers and operations of the confederation, in short all the
circumstances, which had a tendency to produce, or to obstruct its formation and
ratification, deserve a careful attention. Much, also, may be gathered from
contemporary history, and contemporary interpretation, to aid us in just
conclusions.

§ 406.
</b>
It is obvious, however, that
contemporary interpretation must be resorted to with much qualification and
reserve. In the first place, the private interpretation of any particular man,
or body of men, must manifestly be open to much observation. The constitution
was adopted by the people of the United States; and it was submitted to the
whole upon a just survey of its provisions, as they stood in the text itself. In
different states and in different conventions, different and very opposite
objections are known to have prevailed; and might well be presumed to prevail.
Opposite interpretations, and different explanations of different provisions,
may well be presumed to have been presented in different bodies, to remove local
objections, or to win local favour. And there can be no certainty, either that
the different state conventions in ratifying the constitution, gave the same
uniform interpretation to its language, or that, even in a single state
convention, the same reasoning prevailed with a majority, much less with the
whole of the supporters of it. In the interpretation of a state statute, no man
is insensible of the extreme danger of resorting to the opinions of those, who
framed it, or those who passed it. Its terms may have differently impressed
different minds. Some may have implied limitations and objects, which others
would have rejected. Some may have taken a cursory view of its enactments, and
others have studied them with profound attention. Some may have been governed by
a temporary interest or excitement, and have acted upon that exposition, which
most favoured their present views. Others may have seen lurking beneath its
text, what commended it to their judgment against even present interests. Some
may have interpreted its language strictly and closely; others from a different
habit of thinking may have given it a large and liberal meaning. It is not to be
presumed, that, even in the convention, which framed the constitution, from the
causes above mentioned, and other causes, the clauses were always understood in
the same sense, or had precisely the same extent of operation. Every member
necessarily judged for himself; and the judgment of no one could, or ought to
be, conclusive upon that of others. The known diversity of construction of
different parts of it, as well of the mass of its powers, in the different state
conventions; the total silence upon many objections, which have since been
started; and the strong reliance upon others, which have since been universally
abandoned, add weight to these suggestions. Nothing but the text itself was
adopted by the people. And it would certainly be a most extravagant doctrine to
give to any commentary then made, and,
<i>
a fortiori
</i>
, to any commentary
since made under a very different posture of feeling and opinion, an authority,
which should operate an absolute limit upon the text, or should supersede its
natural and just interpretation.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0407">
</a>
<b>
§ 407.
</b>
Contemporary construction is
properly resorted to, to illustrate, and confirm the text, to explain a doubtful
phrase, or to expound an obscure clause; and in proportion to the uniformity and
universality of that construction, and the known ability and talents of those,
by whom it was given, is the credit, to which it is entitled. It can never
abrogate the text; it can never fritter away its obvious sense; it can never
narrow down its true limitations; it can never enlarge its natural boundaries.
<a href="#010">

<sup>

</b>
</a>
We shall have abundant reason
hereafter to observe, when we enter upon the analysis of the particular clauses
of the constitution, how many loose interpretations, and plausible conjectures
were hazarded at an early period, which have since silently died away, and are
now retained in no living memory, as a topic either of praise or blame, of alarm
or of congratulation.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0408">
</a>
<b>
§ 408.
</b>
And, after all, the most
unexceptionable source of collateral interpretation is from the practical
exposition of the government itself in its various departments upon particular
questions discussed, and settled upon their own single merits. These approach
the nearest in their own nature to judicial expositions; and have the same
general recommendation, that belongs to the latter. They are decided upon solemn
argument,
<i>
pro re nata
</i>
, upon a doubt raised, upon a
<i>
lis mota
</i>
,
upon a deep sense of their importance and difficulty, in the face of the nation,
with a view to present action, in the midst of jealous interests, and by men
capable of urging, or repelling the grounds of argument, from their exquisite
genius, their comprehensive learning, or their deep meditation upon the
absorbing topic. How light, compared with these means of instruction, are the
private lucubrations of the closet, or the retired speculations of ingenious
minds, intent on theory, or general views, and unused to encounter a practical
difficulty at every step!
</p>
<p>
<a id="0409">
</a>
<b>
§ 409.
</b>
But to return to the rules of
interpretation arising
<i>
ex directo
</i>
from the text of the constitution. And
first the rules to be drawn from the nature of the instrument. (1.) It is to be
construed, as a
<i>
frame
</i>
, or
<i>
fundamental law
</i>
of government,
established by the

<b>
PEOPLE
</b>

of the United States,
according to their own free pleasure and sovereign will. In this respect it is
in no wise distinguishable from the constitutions of the state governments. Each
of them is established by the people for their own purposes, and each is founded
on their supreme authority. The powers, which are conferred, the restrictions,
which are imposed, the authorities, which are exercised, the organization and
distribution thereof, which are provided, are in each case for the same object,
the common benefit of the governed, and not for the profit or dignity of the
rulers.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0410">
</a>
<b>
§ 410.
</b>
And yet it has been a very common
mode of interpretation to insist upon a diversity of rules in construing the
state constitutions, and that of the general government. Thus, in the
Commentaries of Mr. Tucker upon Blackstone, we find it laid down, as if it were
an incontrovertible doctrine in regard to the constitution of the United States,
that "as federal, it is to be construed strictly, in all cases, where the
antecedent rights of a state may be drawn in question." As a social
compact, it ought likewise "to receive the same strict construction,
wherever the right of personal liberty, of personal security, or of private
property may become the object of dispute; because every person, whose liberty
or property was thereby rendered subject to the new government, was antecedently
a member of a civil society, to whose regulations he had submitted himself, and
under whose authority and protection he still remains, in all cases not
expressly submitted to the new government."
<a href="#013">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a id="0411">
</a>
<b>
§ 411.
</b>
We here see, that the whole
reasoning is founded, not on the notion, that the rights of the people are
concerned, but the rights of the states. And by strict construction is obviously
meant the most limited sense belonging to the words. And the learned author
relies, for the support of his reasoning, upon some rules laid down by Vattel in
relation to the interpretation of treaties in relation to odious things. It
would seem, then, that the constitution of the United States is to be deemed an
odious instrument. And why, it may be asked? Was it not framed for the good of
the people, and by the people? One of the sections of Vattel, which is relied
on, states this proposition,
<a href="#014">
<b>
<sup>
14
</sup>
</b>
</a>
"That
whatever tends to change the present state of things, is also to be ranked in
the class of odious things." Is it not most manifest, that this proposition
is, or at least may be, in many cases, fundamentally wrong? If a people free
themselves from a despotism, is it to be said, that the change of government is
odious, and ought to be construed strictly? What, upon such a principle, is to
become of the American Revolution; and of our state governments, and state
constitutions? Suppose a well-ordered government arises out of a state of
disorder and anarchy, is such a government to be considered odious? Another
section
<a href="#015">
<b>
<sup>
15
</sup>
</b>
</a>
adds, "Since odious
things are those, whose restriction tends more certainly to equity than their
extension, and since we ought to pursue that line, which is most conformable to
equity, when the will of the legislature or of the contracting parties is not
exactly known, we should, where there is a question of odious things, interpret
the terms in the most limited sense. We may even, to a certain degree, adopt a
figurative meaning in order to avert the oppressive consequences of the proper
and literal sense, or any thing of an odious nature, which it would involve."
Does not this section contain most lax and unsatisfactory ingredients for
interpretation? Who is to decide, whether it is most conformable to equity to
extend, or to restrict the sense? Who is to decide, whether the provision is
odious? According to this rule, the most opposite interpretations of the same
words would be equally correct, according as the interpretator should deem it
odious or salutary. Nay, the words are to be deserted, and a figurative sense
adopted, whenever he deems it advisable, looking to the odious nature or
consequence of the common sense. He, who believes the general government founded
in wisdom, and sound policy, and the public safety, may extend the words. He,
who deems it odious, or the state governments the truest protection of all our
rights, must limit the words to the narrowest meaning.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0412">
</a>
<b>
§ 412.
</b>
The twelfth amendment to the
constitution is also relied on by the same author, which declares, "that
the powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to
the people." He evidently supposes, that this means "in all cases not
expressly submitted to the new government"; yet the word "expressly"
is no where found in the amendment. But we are not considering, whether any
powers can be implied; the only point now before us is, how the express powers
are to be construed. Are they to be construed strictly, that is, in their most
limited sense? Or are they to receive a fair and reasonable construction,
according to the plain meaning of the terms and the objects, for which they are
used?
</p>
<p>
<a id="0413">
</a>
<b>
§ 413.
</b>
When it is said, that the
constitution of the United States should be construed strictly, viewed as a
social compact, whenever it touches the rights of property, or of personal
security, or liberty, the rule is equally applicable to the state constitutions
in the like eases. The principle, upon which this interpretation rests, if it
has any foundation, must be, that the people ought not to be presumed to yield
up their rights of property or liberty, beyond what is the clear sense of the
language and the objects of the constitution. All governments are founded on a
surrender of some natural rights, and impose some restrictions. We may not be at
liberty to extend the grants of power beyond the fair meaning of the words in
any such case; but that is not the question here under discussion. It is, how we
are to construe the words as used, whether in the most confined, or in the more
liberal sense properly belonging to them. Now, in construing a grant, or
surrender of powers by the people to a monarch, for his own benefit or use, it
is not only natural, but just, to presume, as in all other cases of grants, that
the parties had not in view any large sense of the terms, because the objects
were a derogation permanently from their rights and interests. But in construing
a constitution of government, framed by the people for their own benefit and
protection, for the preservation of their rights, and property, and liberty;
where the delegated powers are not, and cannot be used for the benefit of their
rulers, who are but their temporary servants and agents; but are intended solely
for the benefit of the people, no such presumption of an intention to use the
words in the most restricted sense necessarily arises. The strict, or the more
extended sense, both being within the letter, may be fairly held to be within
their intention, as either shall best promote the very objects of the people in
the grant; as either shall best promote or secure their rights, property, or
liberty. The words are not, indeed, to be stretched beyond their fair sense; but
within that range, the rule of interpretation must be taken, which best follows
out the apparent intention.
<a href="#016">
<b>
<sup>
16
</sup>
</b>
</a>
This is
the mode (it is believed) universally adopted in construing the state
constitutions. It has its origin in common sense. And it never can be a matter
of just jealousy; because the rulers can have no permanent interest in a free
government, distinct from that of the people, of whom they are a part, and to
whom they are responsible. Why the same reasoning should not apply to the
government of the United States, it is not very easy to conjecture.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0414">
</a>
<b>
§ 414.
</b>
But it is said, that the state
governments being already in existence, and the people subjected to them, their
obedience to the new government may endanger their obedience to the states, or
involve them in a conflict of authority, and thus produce inconvenience. In the
first place, it is not true, in a just sense, (if we are right in our view of
the constitution of the United States,) that such a conflict can ultimately
exist. For if the powers of the general government are of paramount and supreme
obligation, if they constitute the supreme law of the land, no conflict, as to
obedience, can be found. Whenever the question arises, as to whom obedience is
due, it is to be judicially settled; and being settled, it regulates, at once,
the rights and duties of all the citizens.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0415">
</a>
<b>
§ 415.
</b>
In the next place, the powers given
by the people to the general government are not necessarily carved out of the
powers already confided by them to the state governments. They may be such, as
they originally reserved to themselves. And, if they are not, the authority of
the people, in their sovereign capacity, to withdraw power from their state
functionaries, and to confide it to the functionaries of the general government,
cannot be doubted or denied.
<a href="#017">
<b>
<sup>
17
</sup>
</b>
</a>
If they
withdraw the power from the state functionaries, it must be presumed to be,
because they deem it more useful for themselves, more for the common benefit,
and common protection, than to leave it, where it has been hitherto deposited.
Why should a power in the hands of one functionary be differently construed in
the hands of another functionary, if, in each case, the same object is in view,
the safety of the people " The state governments have no right to assume,
that the power is more safe or more useful with them, than with the general
government; that they have a higher capacity and a more honest desire to
preserve the rights and liberties of the people, than the general government;
that there is no danger in trusting them; but that all the peril and all the
oppression impend on the other side. The people have not so said, or thought;
and they have the exclusive right to judge for themselves on the subject. They
avow, that the constitution of the United States was adopted by them, "in
order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic
tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and
secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity." It
would be a mockery to ask, if these are odious objects. If these require every
grant of power, withdrawn from the state governments, to be deemed strictissimi
juris, and construed in the most limited sense, even if it should defeat these
objects. What peculiar sanctity have the state governments in the eyes of the
people beyond these objects? Are they not framed for the same general ends? Was
not the very inability of the state governments suitably to provide for our
national wants, and national independence, and national protection, the very
groundwork of the whole system?
</p>
<p>
<a id="0416">
</a>
<b>
§ 416.
</b>
If this be the true view of the
subject, the constitution of the United States is to receive as favourable a
construction, as those of the states. Neither is to be construed alone; but each
with a reference to the other. Each belongs to the same system of government;
each is limited in its powers; and within the scope of its powers each is
supreme. Each, by the theory of our government, is essential to the existence
and due preservation of the powers and obligations of the other. The destruction
of either would be equally calamitous, since it would involve the ruin of that
beautiful fabric of balanced government, which has been reared with so much care
and wisdom, and in which the people have reposed their confidence, as the truest
safeguard Or their civil, religious, and political liberties. The exact limits
of the powers confided by the people to each, may not always be capable, from
the inherent difficulty of the subject, of being defined, or ascertained in all
cases with perfect certainty.
<a href="#018">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
But the
lines are generally marked out with sufficient broadness and clearness; and in
the progress of the development of the peculiar functions of each, the part of
true wisdom would seem to be, to leave in every practicable direction a wide, if
not an unmeasured, distance between the actual exercise of the sovereignty of
each. In every complicated machine slight causes may disturb the operations; and
it is often more easy to detect the defects, than to apply a safe and adequate
remedy.

The language of the Supreme Court,
in the case of
<i>
Martin v. Hunter
</i>
,
<a href="#019">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
seems peculiarly appropriate to this part of our subject. "The constitution
of the United States," say the court, "was ordained and established,
not by the states in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the
preamble of the constitution declares, by the people of the United States.
<a href="#020">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
There can be no doubt, that it was
competent to the people to invest the general government with all the powers,
which they might deem proper and necessary; to extend or restrain those powers
according to their own good pleasure; and to give them a paramount and supreme
authority. As little doubt can there be, that the people had a right to prohibit
to the states the exercise of any powers, which were in their judgment
incompatible with the objects of the general compact; to make the powers of the
state governments, in given cases, subordinate to those of the nation; or to
reserve to themselves those sovereign authorities, which they might not choose
to delegate to either. The constitution was hot, therefore, necessarily carved
out of existing state sovereignties, nor a surrender of powers already existing
in state institutions. For the powers of the state governments depend upon their
own constitutions; and the people of every state had a right to modify or
restrain them according to their own views of policy or principle. On the other
hand, it is perfectly clear, that the sovereign powers, vested in the state
governments by their respective constitutions, remained unaltered and
unimpaired, except so far as they were granted to the government of the United
States." These deductions do not rest upon general reason, plain and
obvious as they seem to be. They have been positively recognised by one of the
articles in amendment of the constitution, which declares, that "the powers
not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to
the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."
<a href="#021">

<p>
"The government, then, of the United States, can claim no powers, which
are not granted to it by the constitution; and the powers actually granted must
be such, as are expressly given, or given by necessary implication. On the other
hand, this instrument, like every other grant, is to have a reasonable
construction according to the import of its terms. And where a power is
expressly given in general terms, it is not to be restrained to particular
cases, unless that construction grow out of the context expressly, or by
necessary implication. The words are to be taken in their natural and obvious
sense, and not in a sense unreasonably restricted or enlarged."

A still more striking response to
the argument for a strict construction of the constitution will be found in the
language of the court, in the case of
<i>
Gibbons v. Ogden
</i>
, (9 Wheat. 1, &amp;c.)
Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of the court, says,
</p>
<p>
"This instrument contains an enumeration of powers expressly granted by
the people to their government. It has been said, that these powers ought to be
construed strictly. But why ought they to be so construed? Is there one sentence
in the constitution, which gives countenance to this rule? In the last of the
enumerated powers, that, which grants expressly the means for carrying all
others into execution, congress is authorized " to make all laws, which
shall be necessary and proper" for the purpose. But this limitation on the
means, which may be used, is not extended to the powers, which are conferred;
nor is there one sentence in the constitution, which has been pointed out by the
gentlemen of the bar, or which we have been able to discern, that prescribes
this rule. We do not, therefore, think ourselves justified in adopting it. What
do gentlemen mean by a strict construction? If they contend only against that
enlarged construction, which would extend words beyond their natural and obvious
import, we might question the application of the terms, but should not
controvert the principle. If they contend for that narrow construction, which,
in support of some theory not to be found in the constitution, would deny to the
government those powers, which the words of the grant, as usually understood,
import, and which are consistent with the general views and objects of the
instrument; for that narrow construction, which would cripple the government,
and render it unequal to the objects, for which it is declared to be instituted,
and to which the powers given, as fairly understood, render it competent; then
we cannot perceive the propriety of this strict construction, nor adopt it as
the rule, by which the constitution is to be expounded. As men, whose intentions
require no concealment, generally employ the words, which most directly and
aptly express the ideas they intend to convey; the enlightened patriots, who
framed our constitution, and the people, who adopted it, must be understood to
have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended, what they have
said. If, from the imperfection of human language, there should be serious
doubts respecting the extent of any given power, it is a well settled rule, that
the objects, for which it was given, especially, when those objects are
expressed in the instrument itself, should have great influence in the
construction. We know of no reason for excluding this rule from the present
case. The grant does not convey power, which might be beneficial to the grantor,
if retained by himself, or which can ensure solely to the benefit of the
grantee; but is an investment of power for the general advantage, in the hands
of agents selected for that purpose; which power can never be exercised by the
people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of agents, or lie dormant. We
know of no rule for construing the extent of such powers, other than is given by
the language of the instrument, which confers them, taken in connexion with the
purposes, for which they were conferred."

It has been remarked by President J. Q. Adams, that "it is a
circumstance, which will not escape the observation of a philosophical
historian, that the constructive powers of the national government have been
stretched to their extremest tension by that party when in power, which has been
most tenderly scrupulous of the state sovereignty, when uninvested with the
authority of the union themselves." He Adds, "Of these
inconsistencies, our two great parties can have little to say in reproof of each
other." Without inquiring into the justice of the remark in general, it may
be truly stated. that the Embargo of 1807, and the admission of Louisiana into
the Union, are very striking illustrations of the application of constructive
powers.

IV. From the foregoing
considerations we deduce the conclusion, that as a frame or fundamental law of
government, (2.) The constitution of the United States is to receive a
reasonable interpretation of its language, and its powers, keeping in view the
objects and purposes, for which those powers were conferred. By a reasonable
interpretation, we mean, that in case the words are susceptible of two different
senses, the one strict, the other more enlarged, that should be adopted, which
is most consonant with the apparent objects and intent of the constitution;
that, which will give it efficacy and force, as a government, rather than that,
which will impair its operations, and reduce it to a state of imbecility. Of
course we do not mean, that the words for this purpose are to be strained beyond
their common and natural sense; but keeping within that limit, the exposition is
to have a fair and just latitude, so as on the one hand to avoid obvious
mischief, and on the other hand to promote the public good.

§ 420.
</b>
This consideration is of great
importance in construing a frame of government; and
<i>
a fortiori
</i>
a frame
of government, the free and voluntary institution of the people for their common
benefit, security, and happiness. It is wholly unlike the case of a municipal
charter, or a private grant, in respect both to its means and its ends. When a
person makes a private grant of a particular thing, or of a license to do a
thing, or of an easement for the exclusive benefit of the grantee, we naturally
confine the terms, however general, to the objects clearly in the view of the
parties. But even in such cases, doubtful words, within the scope of those
objects, are construed most favourably for the grantee; because, though in
derogation of the rights of the grantor, they are promotive of the general
rights secured to the grantee. But, where the grant enures, solely and
exclusively, for the benefit of the grantor himself, no one would deny the
propriety of giving to the words of the grant a benign and liberal
interpretation. In cases, however, of private grants, the objects generally are
few; they are certain; they are limited; they neither require, nor look to a
variety of means or changes, which are to control, or modify either the end, or
the means.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0421">
</a>
<b>
§ 421.
</b>
In regard also to municipal
charters, or public grants, similar considerations usually apply. They are
generally deemed restrictive of the royal or public prerogative, or of the
common rights secured by the actual organization of the government to other
individuals, or communities. They are supposed to be procured, not so much for
public good, as for private or local convenience. They are supposed to arise
from personal solicitation, upon general suggestions, and not
<i>
ex certa causa
</i>
,
or
<i>
ex mero motu
</i>
of the king, or government itself. Hence, such charters
are often required by the municipal jurisprudence to be construed strictly,
because they yield something, which is common, for the benefit of a few. And
yet, where it is apparent, that they proceed upon greater or broader motives, a
liberal exposition is not only indulged, but is encouraged, if it manifestly
promotes the public good.
<a href="#024">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
So that we
see, that even in these cases, common sense often dictates a departure from a
narrow and strict construction of the terms, though the ordinary rules of mere
municipal law may not have favoured it.

§ 422.
</b>
But a constitution of government,
founded by the people for themselves and their posterity, and for objects of the
most momentous nature, for perpetual union, for the establishment of justice,
for the general welfare, and for a perpetuation of the blessings of liberty,
necessarily requires, that every interpretation of its powers should have a
constant reference to these objects. No interpretation of the words, in which
those powers are granted, can be a sound one, which narrows down their ordinary
import, so as to defeat those objects. That would be to destroy the spirit, and
to cramp the letter. It has been justly observed, that " the constitution
unavoidably deals in general language. It did not suit the purposes of the
people, in framing this great charter of our liberties, to provide for minute
specification of its powers, or to declare the means, by which those powers
should be carried into execution. It was foreseen, that it would be a perilous,
and difficult, if not an impracticable task. The instrument was not intended to
provide merely for the exigencies of a few years; but was to endure through a
long lapse of ages, the events of which were locked up in the inscrutable
purposes of Providence. It could not be foreseen, what new changes and
modifications of power might be indispensable to effectuate the general objects
of the charter; and restrictions and specifications, which at the present might
seem salutary, might in the end prove the overthrow of the system itself. Hence
its powers are expressed in general terms, leaving the legislature, from time to
time, to adopt its own means to effectuate legitimate objects, and to mould and
model the exercise of its powers, as its own wisdom and the public interests
should require."

If, then, we are to give a
reasonable construction to this instrument, as a constitution of government
established for the common good, we must throw aside all notions of subjecting
it to a strict interpretation, as if it were subversive of the great interests
of society, or derogated from the inherent sovereignty of the people. And this
will naturally lead us to some other rules properly belonging to the subject.

V. Where the power is granted in
general terms, the power is to be construed, as co-extensive with the terms,
unless some clear restriction upon it is deducible from the context. We do not
mean to assert, that it is necessary, that such restriction should be expressly
found in the context. It will be sufficient, if it arise by necessary
implication. But it is not sufficient to show, that there was, or might have
been, a sound or probable motive to restrict it. A restriction founded on
conjecture is wholly inadmissible. The reason is obvious: the text was adopted
by the people in its obvious, and general sense. We have no means of knowing,
that any particular gloss, short of this sense, was either contemplated, or
approved by the people; and such a gloss might, though satisfactory in one
state, have been the very ground of objection in another. It might have formed a
motive to reject it in one, and to adopt it in another. The sense of a part of
the people has no title to be deemed the sense of the whole. Motives of state
policy, or state interest, may properly have influence in the question of
ratifying it; but the constitution itself must be expounded, as it stands; and
not as that policy, or that interest may seem now to dictate. We are to
construe, and not to frame the instrument.

§ 425.
</b>
VI. A power, given in general terms,
is not to be restricted to particular cases, merely because it may be
susceptible of abuse, and, if abused, may lead to mischievous consequences. This
argument is often used in public debate; and in its common aspect addresses
itself so much to popular fears and prejudices, that it insensibly acquires a
weight in the public mind, to which it is no wise entitled. The argument
<i>
ab
inconvenienti
</i>
is sufficiently open to question, from the laxity of
application, as well as of opinion, to which it leads. But the argument from a
possible abuse of a power against its existence or use, is, in its nature, not
only perilous, but, in respect to governments, would shake their very
foundation. Every form of government unavoidably includes a grant of some
discretionary powers. It would be wholly imbecile without them. It is impossible
to foresee all the exigencies, which may arise in the progress of events,
connected with the rights, duties, and operations of a government. If they could
be foreseen, it would be impossible
<i>
ab ante
</i>
to provide for them. The
means must be subject to perpetual modification, and change; they must be
adapted to the existing manners, habits, and institutions of society, which are
never stationary; to the pressure of dangers, or necessities; to the ends in
view; to general and permanent operations, as well as to fugitive and
extraordinary emergencies. In short, if the whole society is not to be
revolutionized at every critical period, and remodeled in every generation,
there must be left to those, who administer the government, a very large mass of
discretionary powers, capable of greater or less actual expansion according to
circumstances, and sufficiently flexible not to involve the nation in utter
destruction from the rigid limitations imposed upon it by an improvident
jealousy. Every power, however limited, as well as broad, is in its own nature
susceptible of abuse. No constitution can provide perfect guards against it.
Confidence must be reposed some where; and in free governments, the ordinary
securities against abuse are found in the responsibility of rulers to the
people, and in the just exercise of their elective franchise; and ultimately in
the sovereign power of change belonging to them, in cases requiring
extraordinary remedies. Few cases are to be supposed, in which a power, however
general, will be exerted for the permanent oppression of the people.
<a href="#028">
<b>
<sup>
28
</sup>
</b>
</a>
And yet, cases may easily be put, in
which a limitation upon such a power might be found in practice to work
mischief; to incite foreign aggression; or encourage domestic disorder. The
power of taxation, for instance, may be carried to a ruinous excess; and yet, a
limitation upon that power might, in a given case, involve the destruction of
the independence of the country.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0426">
</a>
<b>
§ 426.
</b>
VII. On the other hand, a rule of
equal importance is, not to enlarge the construction of a given power beyond the
fair scope of its terms, merely because the restriction is inconvenient,
impolitic, or even mischievous.
<a href="#029">
<b>
<sup>
29
</sup>
</b>
</a>
If it
be mischievous, the power of redressing the evil lies with the people by an
exercise of the power of amendment. If they do not choose to apply the remedy,
it may fairly be presumed, that the mischief is less than what would arise from
a further extension of the power; or that it is the least of two evils. Nor
should it ever be lost sight of, that the government of the United States is one
of limited and enumerated powers; and that a departure from the true import and
sense of its powers is,
<i>
pro tanto
</i>
, the establishment of a new constitution. It is doing for the
people, what they hare not chosen to do for themselves It is usurping the
functions of a legislator, and deserting those of an expounder of the law.
Arguments drawn from impolicy or inconvenience ought here to be of no weight.
The only sound principle is to declare,
<i>
ita lex scripta est
</i>
, to follow,
and to obey. Nor, if a principle so just and conclusive could be overlooked,
could there well be found a more unsafe guide in practice, than mere policy and
convenience. Men on such subjects complexionally differ from each other. The
same men differ from themselves at different times. Temporary delusions,
prejudices, excitements, and objects have irresistible influence in mere
questions of policy. And the policy of one age may ill suit the wishes, or the
policy of another. The constitution is not to be subject to such fluctuations.
It is to have a fixed, uniform, permanent construction. It should be, so far at
least as human infirmity will allow, not dependent upon the passions or parties
of particular times, but the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0427">

<b>
§ 427.
</b>
It has been observed with great
correctness, that although the spirit of an instrument, especially of a
constitution, is to be respected not less than its letter; yet the spirit is to
be collected chiefly from the letter. It would be dangerous in the extreme, to
infer from extrinsic circumstances, that a case, for which the words of an
instrument expressly provide, shall be exempted from its operation. Where words
conflict with each other, where the different clauses of an instrument bear upon
each other, and would be inconsistent, unless the natural and common import of
words be varied, construction becomes necessary, and a departure from the
obvious meaning of words is justifiable. But if, in any case, the plain meaning
of a provision, not contradicted by any other provision in the same instrument,
is to be disregarded, because we believe the framers of that instrument could
not intend what they say, it must be one, where the absurdity and injustice of
applying the provision to the case would be so monstrous, that all mankind
would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application.
<a href="#030">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
This language has reference to a case where the words of a constitutional
provision are sought to be restricted. But it appears with equal force where
they are sought to be enlarged.

<a id="0428">

§ 428.
</b>
VIII. No construction of a given
power is to be allowed, which plainly defeats, or impairs its avowed objects.
If, therefore, the words are fairly susceptible of two interpretations,
according to their common sense and use, the one of which would defeat one, or
all of the objects, for which it was obviously given, and the other of which
would preserve and promote all, the former interpretation ought to be rejected,
and the latter be held the true interpretation. This rule results from the
dictates of mere common sense; for every instrument ought to be so construed,
<i>
ut magis valeat, quam pereat
</i>
.
<a href="#031">
<b>
<sup>
31
</sup>
</b>
</a>
For instance, the constitution confers on congress the power to declare war. Now
the word declare has several senses. It may mean to proclaim, or publish. But no
person would imagine, that this was the whole sense, in which the word is used
in this connexion. It should be interpreted in the sense, in which the phrase is
used among nations, when applied to such a subject matter. A power to declare
war is a power to make, and carry on war. It is not a mere power to make known
an existing thing, but to give life and effect to the thing itself.
<a href="#032">

The true doctrine has been expressed
by the Supreme Court: "If from the imperfection of human language there
should be any serious doubts respecting the extent of any given power, the
objects, for which it was given, especially when those objects are expressed in
the instrument itself, should have great influence in the construction."

IX. Where a power is remedial in its
nature, there is much reason to contend, that it ought to be construed
liberally. That was the doctrine of Mr. Chief Justice Jay, in
<i>
Chisholm v.
Georgia
</i>
;
<a href="#034">
<b>

</a>
and it is generally
adopted in the interpretation of laws.
<a href="#035">

the just and ordinary sense of the terms.

<p>
<a id="0430">
</a>
<b>
§ 430.
</b>
X. In the interpretation of a power,
all the ordinary and appropriate means to execute it are to be deemed a part of
the power itself. This results from the very nature and design of a
constitution. In giving the power, it does not intend to limit it to any one
mode of exercising it, exclusive of all others. It must be obvious, (as has been
already suggested,) that the means of carrying into effect the objects of a
power may, nay, must be varied, in order to adapt themselves to the exigencies
of the nation at different times.
<a href="#036">
<b>
<sup>
36
</sup>
</b>
</a>
A
mode efficacious and useful in one age, or under one posture of circumstances,
may be wholly vain, or even mischievous at another time. Government presupposes
the existence of a perpetual mutability in its own operations on those, who are
its subjects; and a perpetual flexibility in adapting itself to their wants,
their interests, their habits, their occupations, and their infirmities.

<b>
§ 431.
</b>
Besides; if the power only is given,
without pointing out the means, how are we to ascertain, that any one means,
rather than another, is exclusively within its scope? The same course of
reasoning, which those alone, without which the power given would be nugatory,
would have been to deprive the legislature of the capacity to avail itself of
experience, to exercise its reason, and to accommodate its legislation to
circumstances. If we apply this principle of construction to any of the powers
of the government, we shall find it so pernicious in its operation, that we
shall be compelled to discard it. The powers vested in congress may certainly be
curried into execution, without prescribing an oath of office. The power to
exact this security for the faithful performance of duty is not given, nor is it
indispensably necessary. The different departments may be established; taxes may
be imposed and collected; armies and navies may be raised and maintained; and
money may be borrowed, without requiring an oath of office. It might be argued,
with as much plausibility, as other incidental powers have been assailed, that
the convention was not unmindful of this subject. The oath, which might be
exacted -- that of fidelity to the constitution -- is prescribed, and no other
can be required. Yet, he would be charged with insanity, who should contend,
that the legislature might not superadd, to the oath directed by the
constitution, such other oath of office, as its wisdom might suggest.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0432">
</a>
<b>
§ 432.
</b>
In the practical application of
government, then, the public functionaries must be left at liberty to exercise
the powers, with which the people by the constitution and laws have entrusted
them. They must have a wide discretion, as to the choice of means; and the only
limitation upon that discretion would seem to be, that the means are appropriate
to the end. And this must naturally admit of considerable latitude; for the
relation between the action and the end has has been justly remarked is not
always so direct and palpable, as to strike the eye of every observer.
<a href="#040">
<b>
<sup>
40
</sup>
</b>
</a>
If the end be legitimate and within
the scope of the constitution, all the means, which are appropriate, and which
are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, may be
constitutionally employed to carry it into effect.
<a href="#041">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
When, then, it is asked, who is to judge of the necessity and propriety of the
laws to be passed for executing the powers of the Union, the true answer is,
that the national government, like every other, must judge in the first instance
of the proper exercise of its powers; and its constituents in the last. If the
means are within the reach of the power, no other department can inquire into
the policy or convenience of the use of them. If there be an excess by
overleaping the just boundary of the power, the judiciary may generally afford
the proper relief; and in the last resort the people, by adopting such measures
to redress it, as the exigency may suggest, and prudence may dictate.

XI. And this leads us to remark, in
the next place, that in the interpretation of the constitution there is no solid
objection to implied powers.
<a href="#043">
<b>
<sup>
43
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Had the
faculties of man been competent to the framing of a system of government, which
would leave nothing to implication, it cannot be doubted, that the effort would
have been made by the framers of our constitution. The fact, however, is
otherwise. There is not in the whole of that admirable instrument a grant of
powers, which does not draw after it others, not expressed, but vital to their
exercise; not substantive and independent, indeed, but auxiliary and
subordinate.
<a href="#044">
<b>
<sup>
44
</sup>
</b>
</a>
There is no phrase in
it, which, like the articles of confederation,
<a href="#045">
<b>
<sup>
45
</sup>
</b>
</a>
excludes incidental and implied powers, and which requires, that every thing
granted shall be expressly and minutely described. Even the tenth amendment,
which was framed for the purpose of quieting the excessive jealousies, which had
been excited, omits the word "expressly," (which was contained in the
articles of confederation,) and declares only, that "the powers, not
delegated to the United States, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved
to the states respectively, or to the people;" thus leaving the question,
whether the particular power, which may become the subject of contest, has been
delegated to the one government, or prohibited to the other, to depend upon a
fair construction of the whole instrument. The men, who drew and adopted this
amendment, had experienced the embarrassments, resulting from the insertion of
this word in the articles of confederation, and probably omitted it to avoid
those embarrassments. A constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the
subdivisions, of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means, by
which these may be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a
legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably
never be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires, that only
its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the
minor ingredient which compose those objects, be deduced from the nature of
those objects themselves. That this idea was entertained by the framers of the
American constitution, is not only to be inferred from the nature of the
instrument, but from the language. Why, else, were some of the limitations,
found in the ninth section of the first article, introduced? It is also, in some
degree, warranted, by their having omitted to use any restrictive term, which
might prevent its receiving a fair and just interpretation. In considering this
point, we should never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.

§ 434.
</b>
The reasoning of the Federalist is
to the same effect. Every power, which is the means of carrying into effect a
given power, is implied from the very nature of the original grant. It is a
necessary and unavoidable implication from the act of constituting a government,
and vesting it with certain specified powers. What is a power, but the ability
or faculty of doing a thing? What is the ability to do a thing, but the power of
employing the means necessary to its execution? What is a legislative power, but
a power of making laws? What are the means to execute a legislative power, but
laws?
<a href="#047">
<b>
<sup>
47
</sup>
</b>
</a>
No axiom, indeed, is more
clearly established in law or in reason, than that, where the end is required,
the means are authorized. Whenever a general power to do a thing is given, every
particular power necessary for doing it is included. In every new application of
a general power, the particular power, which are the means of attaining the
object of the general power, must always necessarily vary with that object; and
be often properly varied, whilst the object remains the same.
<a href="#048">
<b>
<sup>
48
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Even under the confederation, where the delegation of authority was confined to
express powers, the Federalist remarks, that it would be easy to show, that no
important power delegated by the articles of confederation had been, or could
be, executed by congress, without recurring more or less to the doctrine of
construction or implication!

XII. Another point, in regard to the
interpretation of the constitution, requires us to advert to the rules
applicable to cases of concurrent and exclusive powers. In what cases are the
powers given to the general government exclusive, and in what cases may the
states maintain a concurrent exercise? Upon this subject we have an elaborate
exposition by the authors of the Federalist;
<a href="#050">
<b>
<sup>

</b>

constitution, and those, in which a conflict with the states is most likely to
arise, we cannot do better than to quote the reasoning.

<b>
§ 436.
</b>
"An entire consolidation of the
states into one complete national sovereignty, would imply an entire
subordination of the parts; and whatever powers might remain in them, would be
altogether dependent on the general will. But as the plan of the convention aims
only at a partial union or consolidation, the state governments would clearly
retain all the rights of sovereignty, which they before had, and which were not,
by that act, exclusively delegated to the United States. This exclusive
delegation, or rather this alienation of state sovereignty, would only exist in
three cases: where the constitution in express terms granted an exclusive
authority to the Union; where it granted, in one instance, an authority to the
Union, and in another, prohibited the states from exercising the like authority;
and where it granted an authority to the Union, to which a similar authority in
the states would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant. I use
these terms to distinguish this last case from another, which might appear to
resemble it; but which would, in fact, be essentially different: I mean, where
the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional
interferences in the policy of any branch of administration, but would not imply
any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority.
These three cases of exclusive jurisdiction in the federal government, may be
exemplified by the following instances. The last clause but one in the eighth
section of the first article, provides expressly, that congress shall exercise
'exclusive legislation ' over the district to be appropriated as the seat of
government. This answers to the first case. The first clause of the same section
empowers congress 'to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; ' and
the second clause of the tenth section of the same article declares, that 'no
state shall, without the consent of congress, lay any imposts or duties on
imports or exports, except for the purpose of executing its inspection laws;'
Hence would result an exclusive power in the Union to lay duties on imports and
exports, with the particular exception mentioned. But this power is abridged by
another clause, which declares, that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles
exported from any state; in consequence of which qualification, it now only
extends to the duties on imports. This answers to the second case. The third
will be found in that clause, which declares, that congress shall have power '
to establish an uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United States.'
This must necessarily be exclusive; because, if each state had power to
prescribe a distinct rule, there could be no uniform, rule." The
correctness of these rules of interpretation has never been controverted; and
they have been often recognised by the Supreme Court.

§ 437.
</b>
The two first rules are so
completely self evident, that every attempt to illustrate them would be vain, if
it had not a tendency to perplex and confuse. The last rule, viz. that which
declares, that the power is exclusive in the national government, where an
authority is granted to the Union, to which a similar authority in the states
would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant, is that alone,
which may be thought to require comment. This rule seems, in its own nature, as
little susceptible of doubt, as the others in reference to the constitution.
For, since the constitution has declared, that the constitution and laws, and
treaties in pursuance of it shall be the supreme law of the land; it would be
absurd to say, that a state law, repugnant to it, might have concurrent
operation and validity; and especially, as it is expressly added, any thing in
the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. The
repugnancy, then, being made out, it follows, that the state law is just as much
void, as though it had been expressly declared to be void; or the power in
congress had been expressly declared to be exclusive. Every power given to
congress is by the constitution necessarily supreme; and if, from its nature, or
from the words of the grant, it is apparently intended to be exclusive, it is as
much so, as if the states were expressly forbidden to exercise it.

The principal difficulty lies, not
so much in the rule, as in its application to particular cases. Here, the field
for discussion is wide, and the argument upon construction is susceptible of
great modifications, and of very various force. But unless, from the nature of
the power, or from the obvious results of its operations, a repugnancy must
exist, so as to lead to a necessary conclusion, that the power was intended to
be exclusive, the true rule of interpretation is, that the power is merely
concurrent. Thus, for instance, an affirmative power in congress to lay taxes,
is not necessarily incompatible with a like power in the States. Both may exist
without interference; and if any interference should arise in a particular case,
the question of supremacy would turn, not upon the nature of the power, but upon
supremacy of right in the exercise of the power in that case.

In our complex system, presenting the rare and difficult scheme of one general
government, whose action extends over the whole, but which possesses only
enumerated powers, and of numerous state governments, which retain and exercise
many powers not delegated to the Union, contests respecting power must arise.
Were it even otherwise, the measures taken by the respective governments to
execute their acknowledged powers would be often of the same description, and
might sometimes interfere. This, however, does not prove, that the one is
exercising, or has a right to exercise, the powers of the other.

And this leads us to remark, that in
the exercise of concurrent powers, if there be a conflict between the laws of
the Union and the laws of the state, the former being supreme, the latter must
of course yield. The possibility, nay the probability, of such a conflict was
foreseen by the framers of the constitution, and was accordingly expressly
provided for. If a state passes a law inconsistent with the constitution of the
United States it is a mere nullity. If it passes a law clearly within its own
constitutional powers, still if it conflicts with the exercise of a power given
to congress, to the extent of the interference its operation is suspended; for,
in a conflict of laws, that which is supreme must govern. Therefore, it has
often been adjudged, that if a state law is in conflict with a treaty, or an act
of congress, it becomes
<i>
ipso facto
</i>
inoperative to the extent of the
conflict.

From this great rule, that the
constitution and laws, made in pursuance thereof, are supreme; and that they
control the constitutions and laws of the states, and cannot be controlled by
them, from this, which may be deemed an axiom, other auxiliary corollaries may
be deduced. In the first place, that, if a power is given to create a thing, it
implies a power to preserve it. Secondly, that a power to destroy, if wielded by
a different hand, is hostile to and incompatible with this power to create and
preserve. Thirdly, that where this repugnancy exists, the authority, which is
supreme, must control, and not yield to that, over which it is supreme.

But a question of a still more
delicate nature may arise; and that is, how far in the exercise of a concurrent
power, the actual legislation of congress supersedes the state legislation, or
suspends its operation over the subject matter. Are the state laws inoperative
only to the extent of the actual conflict; or does the legislation of congress
suspend the legislative power of the states over the subject matter? To such an
inquiry, probably, no universal answer could be given. It may depend upon the
nature of the power, the effect of the actual exercise, and the extent of the
subject matter.

§ 442.

This may, perhaps, be best
illustrated by putting a case, which has been reasoned out by a very learned
judge, in his own words:
<a href="#058">
<b>
<sup>
58
</sup>
</b>
</a>
"Congress
has power," says he, "to provide for organizing, arming, and
disciplining the militia; and it is presumable, that the framers of the
constitution contemplated a full exercise of all these powers. Nevertheless, if
congress had declined to exercise them, it was competent to the state
governments to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining their respective
militia in such manner, as they might think proper. But congress has provided
for these subjects in the way, which that body must have supposed the best
calculated to promote the general welfare, and to provide for the national
defence. After this, can the state governments enter upon the same ground,
provide for the same objects, as they may think proper, and punish, in their own
way, violations of the laws they have so enacted? The affirmative of this
question is asserted by counsel, &amp;c. who contend, that unless such state
laws are in direct contradiction to those of the United States, they are not
repugnant to the constitution of the United States. -- From this doctrine I
must, for one, be permitted to dissent. The two laws may not be in such absolute
opposition to each other, as to render the one incapable of execution without
violating the injunctions of the other; and yet the will of the one legislature
may be in direct collision with that of the other. This will is to be
discovered, as well by what the legislature has not declared, as by what they
have expressed. Congress, for example, have declared, that the punishment for
disobedience of the act of congress shall be a certain fine. If that provided by
the state legislature for the same offence be a similar fine with the addition
of imprisonment or death, the latter law would not prevent the former from being
carried into execution, and may be said, therefore, not to be repugnant to it.
But surely the will of Congress is nevertheless thwarted and opposed."
<a href="#059">
<b>
<sup>
59
</sup>
</b>
</a>
He adds, " I consider it a novel
and unconstitutional doctrine, that in cases, where the state governments have a
concurrent power of legislation with the national government, they may legislate
upon any subject, on which congress has acted, provided the two laws are not in
terms, or in their operation contradictory and repugnant to each other."

§ 443.
</b>
Another illustration may be drawn
from the opinion of the court in another highly important case. One question
was, whether the power of congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of
bankruptcies was exclusive, or concurrent with the states. "It does not
appear," it was then said, "to be a violent construction of the
constitution, and is certainly a convenient one, to consider the power of the
states as existing over such cases, as the laws of the Union may not reach. Be
this as it may, the power of congress may be exercised, or declined, as the
wisdom of that body shall decide. If, in the opinion of congress, uniform laws
concerning bankruptcies ought not to be established, it does not follow, that
partial laws may not exist, or that state legislation on the subject must cease.
It is not the mere existence of the power, but its exercise, which is
incompatible with the exercise of the same power by the states. It is not the
right to establish these uniform laws; but their actual establishment, which is
inconsistent with the partial acts of the states. If the right of the states to
pass a bankrupt law is not taken away by the mere grant of that power to
congress, it cannot be extinguished. It can only be suspended by the enactment
of a general bankrupt law. The repeal of that law cannot, it is true, confer the
power on the states; but it removes a disability to its exercise, which was
created by the act of congress"
<a href="#061">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
</p>
<p>
It is not our intention to comment on these cases; but to offer them as
examples of reasoning in favour and against the exclusive power, where a
positive repugnancy cannot be predicated.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0444">
</a>
<b>
§ 444.
</b>
It has been sometimes argued, that
when a power is granted to congress to legislate in specific cases, for purposes
growing out of the Union, the natural conclusion is, that the power is designed
to be exclusive; that the power is to be exercised for the good of the whole by
the will of the whole, and consistently with the interests of the whole; and
that these objects can no where be so clearly seen, or so thoroughly weighed, as
in congress, where the whole nation is represented. But the argument proves too
much; and pursued to its full extent, it would establish, that all the powers
granted to congress are exclusive, unless where concurrent authority is
expressly reserved to the states.
<a href="#062">
<b>
<sup>
62
</sup>
</b>
</a>
For
instance, upon this reasoning the power of taxation in congress would annul the
whole power of taxation of the states; and thus operate a virtual dissolution of
their sovereignty. Such a pretension has been constantly disclaimed.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0445">
</a>
<b>
§ 445.
</b>
On the other hand, it has been
maintained with great pertinacity, that the states possess concurrent authority
with congress in all cases, where the power is not expressly declared to be
exclusive, or expressly prohibited to the states; and if, in the exercise of a
concurrent power, a conflict arises, there is no reason, why each should not be
deemed equally rightful.
<a href="#063">
<b>
<sup>
63
</sup>
</b>
</a>
But it is
plain, that this reasoning goes to the direct overthrow of the principle of
supremacy; and, if admitted, it would enable the subordinate sovereignty to
annul the powers of the superior. There is a plain repugnance in conferring on
one government a power to control the constitutional measures of another, which
other, with respect to these very measures, is declared to be supreme over that,
which exerts the control.
<a href="#064">
<b>
<sup>
64
</sup>
</b>
</a>
For
instance, the states have acknowledgedly a concurrent power of taxation. But it
is wholly inadmissible to allow that power to be exerted over any instrument
employed by the general government to execute its own powers; for such a power
to tax involves a power to destroy; and this power to destroy may defeat, and
render useless the power to create.
<a href="#065">
<b>
<sup>
65
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Thus a state may not tax the mail, the mint, patent rights, custom-house papers,
or judicial process of the courts of the United States.
<a href="#066">
<b>
<sup>
66
</sup>
</b>
</a>
And yet there is no clause in the constitution, which prohibits the states from
exercising the power; nor any exclusive grant to the United States. The apparent
repugnancy creates, by implication, the prohibition. So congress, by the
constitution, possess power to provide for governing such part of the militia,
as may be employed in the service of the United States. Yet it is not said, that
such power of government is exclusive. But it results from the nature of the
power. No person would contend, that a state militia, while in the actual
service and employment of the United States, might yet be, at the same time,
governed and controlled by the laws of the state. The very nature of military
operations would, in such case, require unity of command and direction. And the
argument from inconvenience would be absolutely irresistible to establish an
implied prohibition.
<a href="#067">
<b>
<sup>
67
</sup>
</b>
</a>
On the other
hand, congress have power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining
the militia; but if congress should make no such provision, there seems no
reason, why the states may not organize, arm, and discipline their own militia.
No necessary incompatibility would exist in the nature of the power; though,
when exercised by congress, the authority of the states must necessarily yield.
And, here, the argument from inconvenience would be very persuasive the other
way. For the power to organize, arm, and discipline the militia, in the absence
of congressional legislation, would seem indispensable for the defence and
security of the states.
<a href="#068">
<b>
<sup>
68
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Again,
congress have power to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union,
to suppress insurrections, and repel invasions. But there does not seem any
incompatibility in the states calling out their own militia as auxiliaries for
the same purpose.

In considering, then, this subject,
it would be impracticable to lay down any universal rule, as to what powers are,
by implication, exclusive in the general government, or concurrent in the
states; and in relation to the latter, what restrictions either on the power
itself, or on the actual exercise of the power, arise by implication. In some
cases, as we have seen, there may exist a concurrent power, and yet restrictions
upon it must exist in regard to objects. In other cases, the actual operations
of the power only are suspended or controlled, when there arises a conflict with
the actual operations of the Union. Every question of this sort must be decided
by itself upon its own circumstances and reasons. Because the power to regulate
commerce, from its nature and objects, is exclusive, it does not follow, that
the power to pass bankrupt laws also is exclusive.

<p>

§ 447.
</b>
We may, however, lay down some few
rules, deducible from what has been already said, in respect to cases of implied
prohibitions upon the existence or exercise of powers by the states, as guides
to aid our inquiries. (1.) Wherever the power given to the general government
requires, that, to be efficacious and adequate to its end, it should be
exclusive, there arises a just implication for deeming it exclusive. Whether
exercised, or not, in such a case makes no difference. (2.) Wherever the power
in its own nature is not incompatible with a concurrent power in the states,
either in its nature or exercise, there the power belongs to the states. (3.)
But in such a case, the concurrency of the power may admit of restrictions or
qualifications in its nature, or exercise. In its nature, when it is capable
from its general character of being applied to objects or purposes, which would
control, defeat, or destroy the powers of the general government. In its
exercise, when there arises a conflict in the actual laws and regulations made
in pursuance of the power by the general and state governments. In the former
case there is a qualification engrafted upon the generality of the power,
excluding its application to such objects and purposes. In the latter, there is
(at least generally) a qualification, not upon the power itself, but only upon
its exercise, to the extent of the actual conflict in the operations of each.
(4.) In cases of implied limitations or prohibitions of power, it is not
sufficient to show a possible, or potential inconvenience. There must be a plain
incompatibility, a direct repugnancy, or an extreme practical inconvenience,
leading irresistibly to the same conclusion. (5.) If such incompatibility,
repugnancy, or extreme inconvenience would result, it is no answer, that in the
actual exercise of the power, each party may, if it chooses, avoid a positive
interference with the other. The objection lies to the power itself, and not to
the exercise of it. If it exist, it may be applied to the extent of controlling,
defeating, or destroying the other. It can never be presumed, that the framers
of the constitution, declared to be supreme, could intend to put its powers at
hazard upon the good wishes, or good intentions, or discretion of the states in
the exercise of their acknowledged powers. (6.) Where no such repugnancy,
incompatibility, or extreme inconvenience would result, then the power in the
states is restrained, not in its nature, but in its operations, and then only to
the extent of the actual interference. In fact, it is obvious, that the same
means may often be applied to carry into operation different powers. And a state
may use the same means to effectuate an acknowledged power in itself, which
congress may apply for another purpose in the acknowledged exercise of a very
different power. Congress may make that a regulation of commerce, which a state
may employ as a guard for its internal policy, or to preserve the public health
or peace, or to promote its own peculiar interests.
<a href="#071">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
These rules seem clearly deducible from the nature of the instrument; and they
are confirmed by the positive injunctions of the tenth amendment of the
constitution.

§ 448.

XIII. Another rule of interpretation
deserves consideration in regard to the constitution. There are certain maxims,
which have found their way, not only into judicial discussions, but into the
business of common life, as founded in common sense, and common convenience.
Thus, it is often said, that in an instrument a specification of particulars is
an exclusion of generals; or the expression of one thing is the exclusion of
another. Lord Bacon's remark, "that, as exception strengthens the force of
a law in cases not excepted, so enumeration weakens it in cases not enumerated,"
has been perpetually referred to, as a fine illustration. These maxims, rightly
understood, and rightly applied, undoubtedly furnish safe guides to assist us in
the task of exposition. But they are susceptible of being applied, and indeed
are often ingeniously applied, to the subversion of the text, and the objects of
the instrument. Thus, it has been suggested, that an affirmative provision in a
particular case excludes the existence of the like provision in every other
case; and a negative provision in a particular case admits the existence of the
same thing in every other case.
<a href="#072">
<b>
<sup>
72
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Both
of these deductions are, or rather may be, unfounded in solid reasoning.
<a href="#073">
<b>
<sup>
73
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Thus, it was objected to the
constitution, that, having provided for the trial by jury in criminal cases,
there was an implied exclusion of it in civil cases. As if there was not an
essential difference between silence and abolition, between a positive adoption
of it in one class of cases, and a discretionary right (it being clearly within
the reach of the judicial powers confided to the Union) to adopt, or reject it
in all or any other cases.
<a href="#074">
<b>
<sup>
74
</sup>
</b>
</a>
One might
with just as much propriety hold, that, because congress has power "to
declare war," but no power is expressly given to make peace, the latter is
excluded; or that, because it is declared, that " no bill of attainder, or
<i>
ex post facto
</i>
law shall be passed" by congress, therefore congress
possess in all other cases the right to pass any laws. The truth is, that in
order to ascertain, how far an affirmative or negative provision excludes, or
implies others, we must look to the nature of the provision, the subject matter,
the objects, and the scope of the instrument. These, and these only, can
properly determine the rule of construction. There can be no doubt, that an
affirmative grant of powers in many cases will imply an exclusion of all others.
As, for instance, the constitution declares, that the powers of congress shall
extend to certain enumerated cases. This specification of particulars evidently
excludes all pretensions to a general legislative authority. Why? Because an
affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a
general authority were intended.
<a href="#075">
<b>
<sup>
75
</sup>
</b>
</a>
In
relation, then, to such a subject as a constitution, the natural and obvious
sense of its provisions, apart from any technical or artificial rules, is the
true criterion of construction.

XIV. Another rule of interpretation
of the constitution, suggested by the foregoing, is, that the natural import of
a single clause is not to be narrowed, so as to exclude implied powers resulting
from its character, simply because there is another clause, which enumerates
certain powers, which might otherwise be deemed implied powers within its scope;
for in such cases we are not, as a matter of course, to assume, that the
affirmative specification excludes all other implications. This rule has been
put in a clear and just light by one of our most distinguished statesmen; and
his illustration will be more satisfactory, perhaps, than any other, which can
be offered. "The constitution," says he, "vests in congress,
expressly, the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, and
the power to regulate trade. That the former power, if not particularly
expressed, would have been included in the latter, as one of the objects of a
general power to regulate trade, is not necessarily impugned by its being so
expressed. Examples of this sort cannot sometimes be easily avoided, and are to
be seen elsewhere in the constitution. Thus, the power 'to define and punish
offences against the law of nations' includes the power, afterwards particularly
expressed, 'to make rules concerning captures,' &amp;c. from offending neutrals.
So, also, a power 'to coin money' would, doubtless, include that of'regulating
its value,' had not the latter power been expressly inserted. The term taxes, if
standing alone, would certainly have included 'duties, imposts, and excises.' In
another clause it is said, ' no tax or duty shall be laid on exports.' Here the
two terms are used as synonymous. And in another clause, where it is said 'no
state shall lay any imposts or duties,' &amp;c. the terms imposts and duties are
synonymous. Pleonasms, tautologies, and the promiscuous use of terms and
phrases, differing in their shades of meaning, (always to be expounded with
reference to the context, and under the control of the general character and
scope of the instrument, in which they are found,) are to be ascribed, sometimes
to the purposes of greater caution, sometimes to the imperfection of language,
and sometimes to the imperfection of man himself. In this view of the subject it
was quite natural, however certainly the power to regulate trade might include a
power to impose duties on it, not to omit it in a clause enumerating the several
modes of revenue authorized by the construction. In few cases could the [rule],
<i>
ex majori cautela
</i>
, occur with more claim to respect."

We may close this view of some of
the more important rules to be employed in the interpretation of the
constitution, by adverting to a few belonging to mere verbal criticism, which
are indeed but corollaries from what has been said, and have been already
alluded to; but which, at the same time, it may be of some use again distinctly
to enunciate.

XV. In the first place, then, every
word employed in the constitution is to be expounded in its plain, obvious, and
common sense, unless the context furnishes some ground to control, qualify, or
enlarge it. Constitutions are not designed for metaphysical or logical
subtleties, for niceties of expression, for critical propriety, for elaborate
shades Or meaning, or for the exercise of philosophical acuteness, or judicial
research. They are instruments of a practical nature, founded on the common
business of human life, adapted to common wants, designed for common use, and
fitted for common understandings. The people make them; the people adopt them;
the people must be supposed to read them, with the help of common sense; and
cannot be presumed to admit in them any recondite meaning, or any extraordinary
gloss.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0452">
</a>
<b>
§ 452.
</b>
XVI. But, in the next place, words,
from the necessary imperfection of all human language, acquire different shades
of meaning, each of which is equally appropriate, and equally legitimate; each
of which recedes in a wider or narrower degree from the others, according to
circumstances; and each of which receives from its general use some
indefiniteness and obscurity, as to its exact boundary and extent.
<a href="#078">
<b>
<sup>
78
</sup>
</b>
</a>
We are, indeed, often driven to
multiply commentaries from the vagueness of words in themselves; and perhaps
still more often from the different manner, in which different minds are
accustomed to employ them. They expand or contract, not only from the
conventional modifications introduced by the changes of society; but also from
the more loose or more exact uses, to which men of different talents,
acquirements, and tastes, from choice or necessity apply them. No person can
fail to remark the gradual deflections in the meaning of words from one age to
another; and so constantly is this process going on, that the daily language of
life in one generation sometimes requires the aid of a glossary in another. It
has been justly remarked,
<a href="#079">
<b>
<sup>
79
</sup>
</b>
</a>
that no
language is so copious, as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea;
or so correct, as not to include many, equivocally denoting different ideas.
Hence it must happen, that however accurately objects may be discriminated in
themselves, and however accurately the discrimination may be considered, the
definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms, in
which it is delivered. We must resort then to the context, and shape the
particular meaning, so as to make it fit that of the connecting words, and agree
with the subject matter.
</p>
<p>
<a id="0453">
</a>
<b>
§ 453.

XVII. In the next place, where
technical words are used, the technical meaning is to be applied to them, unless
it is repelled by the context.
<a href="#080">
<b>
<sup>
80
</sup>
</b>
</a>
But
the same word often possesses a technical, and a common sense. In such a case
the latter is to be preferred, unless some attendant circumstance points clearly
to the former. No one would doubt, when the constitution has declared, that "the
privilege of the writ of
<i>
habeas corpus
</i>
shall not be suspended, unless"
under peculiar circumstances, that it referred, not to every sort of writ, which
has acquired that name; but to that, which has been emphatically so called, on
account of its remedial power to free a party from arbitrary imprisonment.

So, again, when it declares, that in
suits at common law, &amp;c. the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,
though the phrase "common law" admits of different meanings, no one
can doubt, that it is used in a technical sense. When, again, it declares, that
congress shall have power to provide a navy, we readily comprehend, that
authority is given to construct, prepare, or in any other manner to obtain a
navy. But when congress is further authorized to provide for calling forth the
militia, we perceive at once, that the word "provide" is used in a
somewhat different sense.

XVIII. And this leads us to remark,
in the next place, that it is by no means a correct rule of interpretation to
construe the same word in the same sense, wherever it occurs in the same
instrument. It does not follow, either logically or grammatically, that because
a word is found in one connexion in the constitution, with a definite sense,
therefore the same sense is to be adopted in every other connexion, in which it
occurs.

</a>
This would be to suppose,
that the framers weighed only the force of single words, as philologists or
critics, and not whole clauses and objects, as statesmen, and practical
reasoners. And yet nothing has been more common, than to subject the
constitution to this narrow and mischievous criticism. Men of ingenious and
subtle minds, who seek for symmetry and harmony in language, having found in the
constitution a word used in some sense, which falls in with their favourite
theory of interpreting it, have made that the standard, by which to measure its
use in every other part of the instrument. They have thus stretched it, as it
were, on the bed of Procrustes, lopping off its meaning, when it seemed too
large for their purposes, and extending it, when it seemed too short. They have
thus distorted it to the most unnatural shapes, and crippled, where they have
sought only to adjust its proportions according to their own opinions. It was
very justly observed by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in
<i>
The Cherokee Nation
v. The State of Georgia
</i>
,
<a href="#083">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
that "it
has been said, that the same words have not necessarily the same meaning
attached to them, when found in different parts of the same instrument Their
meaning is controlled by the context. This is undoubtedly true. In common
language, the same word has various meanings; and the peculiar sense, in which
it is used in any sentence, is to be determined by the context." A very
easy example of this sort will be found in the use of the word "establish,"
which is found in various places in the constitution. Thus, in the preamble, one
object of the constitution is avowed to be "to establish justice,"
which seems here to mean to settle firmly, to fix unalterably, or rather,
perhaps, as justice, abstractedly considered, must be considered as forever
fixed and unalterable, to dispense or administer justice. Again, the
constitution declares, that congress shall have power "to establish an
uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies,"
where it is manifestly used as equivalent to make, or form, and not to fix or
settle unalterably and forever. Again, "congress shall have power to
establish post offices and post-roads," where the appropriate sense would
seem to be to create, to found, and to regulate, not so much with a view to
permanence of form, as to convenience of action. Again, it is declared, that "congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion," which seems to
prohibit any laws, which shall recognise, found, confirm, or patronize any
particular religion, or form of religion, whether permanent or temporary,
whether already existing, or to arise in future. In this clause, establishment
seems equivalent in meaning to settlement, recognition, or support. And again,
in the preamble, it is said, "We, the people, &amp;c. do ordain and
establish this constitution," &amp;c.; where the most appropriate sense
seems to be to create, to ratify, and to confirm. So, the word "state"
will be found used in the constitution in all the various senses, to which we
have before alluded. It sometimes means, the separate sections of territory
occupied by the political societies within each; sometimes the particular
governments established by these societies; sometimes these societies as
organized into these particular governments; and lastly, sometimes the people
composing these political societies in their highest sovereign capacity.

XIX. But the most important rule, in
cases of this nature, is, that a constitution of government does not, and
cannot, from its nature, depend in any great degree upon mere verbal criticism,
or upon the import of single words. Such criticism may not be wholly without
use; it may sometimes illustrate, or unfold the appropriate sense; but unless it
stands well with the context and subject-matter, it must yield to the latter.
While, then, we may well resort to the meaning of single words to assist our
inquiries, we should never forget, that it is an instrument of government we are
to construe; and, as has been already stated, that must be the truest
exposition, which best harmonizes with its design, its objects, and its general
structure.

§ 456.
</b>
The remark of Mr. Burke may, with a
very slight change of phrase be addressed as an admonition to all those, who are
called upon to frame, or to interpret a constitution. Government is a practical
thing made for the happiness of mankind, and not to furnish out a spectacle of
uniformity to gratify the schemes of visionary politicians. The business of
those, who are called to administer it, is to rule, and not to wrangle. It would
be a poor compensation, that one had triumphed in a dispute, whilst we had lost
an empire;

<li><a id="001"></a>"The government of the Union,"says Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of the court inMcCullochv. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, " is emphatically and truly a government ofthe people. It emanates from them; its powers are granted by them, and are to beexercised directly on them and for their benefit."Id. 404, 405;see alsoCohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. R. 264, 413, 414. "Thegovernment of the United States was erected," says Mr. Chancellor Kent,with equal force and accuracy, " by the free voice and the joint will ofthe people of America for their common defence and general welfare." 1Kent'sComm. Lect. 10, p. 189.</li>
<li><a id="002"></a>I have used the expressive words ofMr. Webster, deeming them as exact as any that could be used. See Webster'sSpeeches,p, 410, 418, 419; 4 Elliot'sDebates, 338, 343.</li>

See also Woodes.Elem.ofJurisp. p. 36. -- Rules of a similar nature will be found laid down inVattel, B. 2, ch. 17, from §262 to 310, with more ample illustrations andmore various qualifications. But not a few of his rules appear to me to wantaccuracy and soundness. Bacon'sAbridg. title, Statute I. contains an excellent summary of the rules forconstruing statutes. Domat, also, contains many valuable rule in respect tointerpretation. See hisTreatise on Laws, c. 12, p. 74 &c. andPreliminaryDiscourse, tit. 1, §2, p. 6 to 16.</li>
<li><a id="005"></a>Book 2, ch. 7, §3.</li>
<li><a id="006"></a>The foregoing remarks are borrowedalmost in terms from Rutherforth'sInstitutes of Natural Law(B. 2, ch. 7, §4 to 11), which contain avery lucid exposition of the general rules of interpretation. The whole chapterdeserves an attentive perusal.</li>
<li><a id="007"></a>The value of contemporaryinterpretation is much insisted on by the Supreme Court, inStuart v. Laird,2 Cranch, 299, 309, inMartin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. R. 304, and inCohensv. Virginia, 6 Wheat. R. 264, 418 to 421. There are several instances,however, in which the contemporary interpretations by some of the mostdistinguished founders of the constitution have been overruled. One of the moststriking is to be found in the decision of the Supreme Court of the suability ofa state by any citizen of another state;8and another in the decision by the Executive and the Senate, that the consent ofthe latter is not necessary to removals from office, although it is forappointments.9 8.Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall.419. 9.The Federalist, No. 77.</li>
<li><a id="010"></a>Mr. Jefferson has laid down tworules, which he deems perfect canons for the interpretation of the constitution.11The first is " The capital andlending object of the constitution was, to leave with the states allauthorities, which respected their own citizens only, and to transfer to theUnited States those, which respected citizens of foreign or other states; tomake us several as to ourselves, but one as to all others. In the latter case,then, constructions should lean to the general jurisdiction, if the words willbear it; and in favour of the states in the former, if possible, to be soconstrued." Now, the very theory, on which this canon is founded, iscontradicted by the provisions of the constitution itself. I many instancesauthorities and powers are given, which respect citizens of the respectivestates, without reference to foreigners, or the citizens of other states.12But if this general theory were true,it would furnish no just rule of interpretation, since a particular clause mightform an exception to it; and, indeed, every clause ought, at all events, to beconstrued according to its fair intent and objects, as disclosed in itslanguage. What sort of a rule is that, which, without regard to the intent orobjects of a particular clause, insists, that it shall, if possible, (not ifreasonable) be construed in favour of the states, simply because it respectstheir citizens? The second canon is, " On every question of construction[we should] carry ourselves back to the time, when the constitution was adopted;recollect the spirit manifested in the debates; and instead of trying, whatmeaning may be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to theprobable one, in which it was passed." Now, who does not see the utterlooseness, and incoherence of this canon. How are we to know, what was thoughtof particular clauses of the constitution at the time of its adoption? In manycases, no printed debates give any account of any construction; and where any isgiven, different persons held different doctrines. Whose is to prevail? Besides;of all the state conventions, the debates of five only are preserved, and thesevery imperfectly. What is to be done, as to the other eight states? What is tobe done, as to the eleven new states, which have come into the Union underconstructions, which have been established, against what some persons may deemthe meaning of the framers of it? How are we to arrive at what is the mostprobable meaning? Are Mr. Hamilton, and Mr. Madison, and Mr. Jay, the expoundersin the Federalist, to be followed. Or are others of a different opinion to guideus? Are we to be governed by the opinions of a few, now dead, who have left themon record? Or by those of a few now living, simply because they were actors inthose days, (constituting not one in a thousand of those, who were called todeliberate upon the constitution, and not one in ten thousand of those, who werein favour or against it, among the people)? Or are we to be governed by theopinions of those, who constituted a majority of those, who were called to acton that occasion, either as framers of, or voters upon, the constitution? If bythe latter, in what manner can we know those opinions? Are we to be governed bythe sense of a majority of a particular state, or of all of the United States?If so, how are we to ascertain, what that sense was? Is the sense of theconstitution to be ascertained, not by its own text, but by the "probablemeaning" to be gathered by conjectures from scattered documents, fromprivate papers, from the table talk of some statesmen, or the jealousexaggerations of others? Is the constitution of the United States to be the onlyinstrument, which is not to be interpreted by what is written, but by probableguesses, aside from the text? What would be said of interpreting a statute of astate legislature, by endeavouring to find out, from private sources, theobjects and opinions of every member; how every one thought; what he wished; howhe interpreted it? Suppose different persons had different opinions, what is tobe done? Suppose different persons are not agreed, as to " the probablemeaning " of the framers or of the people, what interpretation is to befollowed? These, and many questions of the same sort, might be asked. It isobvious, that there can be no security to the people in any constitution ofgovernment, if they are not to judge of it by the fair meaning of the words ofthe text; but the words are to be bent and broken by the "probable meaning"of persons, whom they never knew, and whose opinions, and means of information,may be no better than their own? The people adopted the constitution accordingto the words of the text in their reasonable interpretation, and not accordingto the private interpretation of any particular men. The opinions of the lattermay sometimes aid us in arriving at just results; but they can never beconclusive. The Federalist denied, that the president could remove a publicofficer without the consent of the senate. The first congress affirmed his rightby a mere majority. Which is to be followed?</li>

<li><a id="037"></a>The reasoning of Mr. Chief JusticeMarshall on this subject, inMcCulloch v. Maryland, (4 Wheat. 316) is so cogent and satisfactory,that we shall venture to cite it at large. After having remarked, that wordshave various senses, and that what is the true construction of any used in theconstitution must depend upon the subject, the context, and the intentions ofthe people, to he gathered from the instrument, he proceeds thus: "The subject is the execution of those great powers,on which the welfare of a nation essentially depends. It must have been theintention of those, who gave these powers, to insure, as far as human prudencecould insure, their beneficial execution. This could not be done by confidingthe choice of means to such narrow limits, as not to leave it in the power ofcongress to adopt any, which might be appropriate, and which were conducive tothe end. This provision is made in a constitution intended to endure for ages tocome, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.To have prescribed the means, by which government should, in all future time,execute its powers, would have been to change entirely the character of theinstrument, and give it the properties of a legal code. It would have been anunwise attempt to provide, by immutable rules, for exigencies, which, ifforeseen at all, must have been seen dimly, and which can be best provided for,as they occur. To have declared, that the best means shall not be used, butwould deny a choice of means to execute the power, would reduce the power itselfto a nullity. For, as it never could be demonstrated, that any one mode inparticular was intended, and to be exclusively employed; and, as it might bedemonstrated, that other means might be employed, the question, whether thepower were rightfully put into exercise, would for ever be subject to doubt andcontroversy. 1 If one means is adopted to give it effect, and is within itsscope, because it is appropriate, how are we to escape from the argument, thatanother, falling within the same predicament, is equally within its scope? Ifeach is equally appropriate, how is the choice to be made between them? If oneis selected, how does that exclude all others? If one is more appropriate at onetime, and another at another time, where is the restriction to be found, whichallows the one, and denies the other? A power granted in a frame of governmentis not contemplated to be exhausted in a single exertion of it, oruno flatu.It is intended for free and permanent exercise; and if the discretion of thefunctionaries, who are to exercise it, is not limited, that discretion,especially, as those functionaries must necessarily change, must be coextensivewith the power itself. Take, for instance, the power to make war. In one age,this would authorize the purchase and employment of the weapons then ordinarilyused for this purpose. But suppose these weapons are wholly laid aside, andothers substituted, more efficient and powerful; is the government prohibitedfrom employing the new modes of offence and defence? Surely not. The inventionof gunpowder superseded the old modes of warfare, and may perhaps, by futureinventions, be superseded in its turn. No one can seriously doubt, that the newmodes would be within the scope of the power to make war, if they wereappropriate to the end. It would, indeed, be a most extraordinary mode ofinterpretation of the constitution, to give such a restrictive meaning to itspowers, as should obstruct their fair operation. A power being given, it is theinterest of the nation to facilitate its execution. It can never be theirinterest, and cannot be presumed to be their intention, to clog and embarrassits execution, by withholding the most appropriate means. There can be noreasonable ground for preferring that construction, which would render theoperations of the government difficult, hazardous, and expensive; or forimputing to the framers of the constitution a design to impede the exercise ofits powers, by withholding a choice of means.38 "So, with respect to the whole penal code of theUnited States: whence arises the power to punish, in cases not prescribed by theconstitution? All admit, that the government may legitimately, punish anyviolation of its laws; and yet, this is not among the enumerated powers ofcongress. The right to enforce the observance of law, by punishing itsinfraction, might be denied with the more plausibility, because it is expresslygiven in some cases. Congress is empowered 'to provide for the punishment ofcounterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States,' and 'todefine and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offencesagainst the law of nations.' The several powers of congress may exist, in a veryimperfect state to be sure, but they may exist, and be carried into execution,although no punishment should be inflicted in cases, where the right to punishis not expressly given. "Take, for example, the power 'to establish postoffices and post roads.' This power is executed by the single act of making theestablishment. But, from this has been inferred the power, and duty of carryingthe mail along the post road, from one post office to another. And, from thisimplied power has again been inferred the right to punish those, who stealletters from the post office, or rob the mail. It may be said, with someplausibility, that the right to carry the mail, and to punish those, who rob it,is not indispensably necessary to the establishment of a post office, and postroad. This right is indeed essential to the beneficial exercise of the power,but not indispensably necessary to its existence. So, of the punishment of thecrimes of stealing or falsifying a record, or process of a court of the UnitedStates, or of perjury in such court. To punish these offences is certainlyconducive to the due administration of justice. But courts may exist, and maydecide the causes brought before them, though such crimes escape punishment. "The baneful influence of this narrow construction,on all the operations of the government, and the absolute impracticability ofmaintaining it without rendering the government incompetent to its greatobjects, might be illustrated by numerous examples drawn from the constitution,and from our laws. The good sense of the public has pronounced withouthesitation, that the power of punishment appertains to sovereignty, and may beexercised, whenever the sovereign has a right to act, as incidental to hisconstitutional powers. It is a means for carrying into execution all sovereignpowers, and may be used, although not indispensably necessary. It is a rightincidental to the power, and conducive to its beneficial exercise."39 38.McCulloch v. Maryland, 4Wheat. R. 316, 408.</li>
