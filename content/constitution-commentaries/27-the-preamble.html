 § 457. Having disposed of these preliminary inquiries, we are now
arrived at that part of our labours, which involves a commentary upon the
actual provisions of the constitution of the United States. It is proposed to
take up the successive clauses in the order in which they stand in the
instrument itself, so that the exposition may naturally flow from the terms of
the text.
</p>
<b>
 § 458.
</b>
We begin then with the preamble of the constitution. It
is in the following words:
<p>
 "We , the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
union, establish justice, insure "domestic tranquility, provide for the
common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and "establish this
constitution for the United States of America."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 459.
 </b>
 The importance of examining the preamble, for the
purpose of expounding the language of a statute, has been long felt, and
universally conceded in all juridical discussions. It is an admitted maxim in
the ordinary course of the administration of justice, that the preamble of a
statute is a key to open the mind of the makers, as to the mischiefs, which are
to be remedied, and the objects, which are to be accomplished by the provisions
of the statute. We find it laid down in some of our earliest authorities in the
common law; and civilians are accustomed to a similar expression,
</p>
<p>
 cessante legis praemio, cessat et ipsa lex.
 <sup>
  <a href="#1">

  </a>
 </sup>
 Probably it has a foundation
in the exposition of every code of written law, from the universal principle of
interpretation, that the will and intention of the legislature is to be
regarded and followed. It is properly resorted to, where doubts or ambiguities
arise upon the words of the enacting part; for if they are clear and
unambiguous, there seems little room for interpretation, except in cases
leading to an obvious absurdity, or to a direct overthrow of the intention
expressed in the preamble.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 460.
 </b>
 There does not seem any reason why, in a fundamental
law or constitution of government, an equal attention should not be given to
the intention of the framers, as stated in the preamble. And accordingly we
find, that it has been constantly referred to by statesmen and jurists to aid
them in the exposition of its provisions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#2">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 461.
 </b>
 The language of the preamble of the constitution was
probably in a good measure drawn from that of the third article of the
confederation, which declared, that " The said states hereby severally
enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common
defence, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare.
And we accordingly find, that the first resolution proposed, in the convention
which framed the constitution, was, that the articles of the confederation
ought to be so corrected and enlarged, as to accomplish the objects proposed by
their institution, namely, common defence, security of liberty, and general
welfare.
 <sup>
  <a href="#3">
   3
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 § 462. And, here, we must guard ourselves against an error, which is
too often allowed to creep into the discussions upon this subject. The preamble
never can be resorted to, to enlarge the powers confided to the general
government, or any of its departments. It cannot confer any power per se; it
can never amount, by implication, to an enlargement of any power expressly
given. It can never be the legitimate source of any implied power, when
otherwise withdrawn from the constitution. Its true office is to expound the
nature, and extent, and application ofthe powers actually conferred by the
constitution, and not substantively to create them. For example, the preamble
declares one object to be, " to provide for the common defence." No
one can doubt, that this does not enlarge the powers of congress to pass any
measures, which they may deem useful for the common defence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">
   4
  </a>
 </sup>
 But suppose the
terms of a given power admit of two constructions, the one more restrictive,
the other more liberal, and each of them is consistent with the words, but is,
and ought to be, governed by the intent of the power; if one would promote, and
the other defeat the common defence, ought not the former, upon the soundest
principles of interpretation to be adopted? Are we at liberty, upon any
principles of reason, or common sense, to adopt a restrictive meaning, which
will defeat an avowed object of the constitution, when another equally natural
and more appropriate to the object is before us? Would not this be to destroy
an instrument by a measure of its words, which that instrument itself
repudiates?
</p>
<p>
 § 463. We have already had occasion, in considering the nature of the
constitution, to dwell upon the terms, in which the preamble is conceived, and
the proper conclusion deducible from it. It is an act of the people, and not of
the states in their political capacities.
 <sup>
  <a href="#5">
   5
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is an ordinance or establishment
of government and not a compact, though originating in consent; and it binds as
a fundamental law promulgated by the sovereign authority, and not as a compact
or treaty entered into and in fieri, between each and all the citizens of the
United States, as distinct parties. The language is, " We, the people of
the United States," not, We, the states, "do ordain and
establish;" not, do contract and enter into a treaty with each other;
"this constitution for the United States of America," not this treaty
between the several states. And it is, therefore, an unwarrantable assumption,
not to call it a most extravagant stretch of interpretation, wholly at variance
with the language, to substitute other words and other senses for the words and
senses incorporated, in this solemn manner, into the substance of the
instrument itself. We have the strongest assurances, that this preamble was not
adopted as a mere formulary; but as a solemn promulgation of a fundamental
fact, vital to the character and operations of the government. The obvious
object was to substitute a government of the people, for a confederacy of
states; a constitution for a compact.
 <sup>
  <a href="#6">
   6
  </a>
 </sup>
 The difficulties arising from this
source
</p>
<p>
 were not slight; for a notion commonly enough, however incorrectly,
prevailed, that, as it was ratified by the states only, the states
respectively, at their pleasure, might repeal it; and this, of itself, proved
the necessity of laying the foundations of a national government deeper than in
the mere sanction of delegated power. The convention determined, that the
fabric of American empire ought to rest and should rest on the solid basis of
the consent of the people. The streams of national power ought to flow and
should flow immediately from the highest original fountain of all legitimate
authority.
 <sup>
  <a href="#7">
   7
  </a>
 </sup>
 And, accordingly, the advocates of the constitution so treated it
in their reasoning in favour of its adoption. "The constitution,"
said the Federalist, "is to be founded on the assent and ratification of
the people of America, given by deputies elected for that purpose; but this
assent and ratification is to be given by the people, not as individuals
composing a whole nation, but as composing the distinct and independent states,
to which they belong."
 <sup>
  <a href="#8">
   8
  </a>
 </sup>
 And the uniform doctrine of the highest judicial
authority has accordingly been, that it was the act of the people, and not of
the states; and that it bound the latter, as subordinate to the people.
"Let us turn," said Mr. Chief Justice Jay, "to the constitution.
The people therein declare, that their design in establishing it comprehended
six objects: (1.) To form a more perfect union; (2.) to establish justice; (3.)
to insure domestic tranquillity; (4.) to provide for the common defence; (5.)
to promote the general welfare; (6.) to secure the blessings of liberty to
themselves and their posterity. It would," he added, "be pleasing and
useful
</p>
<p>
 to consider and trace the relations, which each of these objects bears to
the others; and to show, that, collectively, they comprise every thing
requisite, with the blessing of Divine Providence, to render a people
prosperous and happy."
 <sup>
  <a href="#9">

 </sup>
 In Hunter v. Martin, (1 Wheat. R. 305, 324,) the
Supreme Court say, (as we have seen,) "the constitution of the United
States was ordained and established, not by the states in their sovereign
capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the constitution declares, by
the people of the United States;" and language still more expressive will
be found used on other solemn occasions.

 But this point has been so much dwelt upon in the
discussion of other topics,
 <sup>
  <a href="#11">
   11
  </a>
 </sup>
 that it is wholly unnecessary to pursue it
further. It does, however, deserve notice, that this phraseology was a matter
of much critical debate in some of the conventions called to ratify the
constitution. On the one hand, it was pressed, as a subject of just alarm to
the states, that the people were substituted for the states; that this would
involve a destruction of the states in one consolidated national government;
and would terminate in the subversion of the public liberties. On the other
hand, it was urged, as the only safe course for the preservation of the Union
and the liberties of the people, that the government should emanate from the
people, and not from the states; that it should not be, like the confederation,
a mere treaty, operating by requisitions on the states; and that the people,
for whose benefit it
</p>
<p>
 was framed, ought to have the sole and exclusive right to ratify, amend,
and control its provisions.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 465.
 </b>
 At this distance of time, after all the passions and
interests, which then agitated the country have passed away, it cannot but be
matter of surprise, that it should have been urged, as a solid objection to a
government intended for the benefit of the people, and to operate directly on
them, that it was required to be ratified by them, and not by bodies politic
created by them for other purposes, and having no implied authority to act on
the subject.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 466.
 </b>
 The constitution having been in operation more than
forty years, and being generally approved, it may, at first sight, seem
unnecessary to enter upon any examination of the manner and extent, to which it
is calculated to accomplish the objects proposed in the preamble, or the
importance of those objects, not merely to the whole, in a national view, but
also to the individual states. Attempts have, however, been made at different
times, in different parts of the Union, to stir up a disaffection to the
theory, as well as the actual exercise of the powers of the general government;
to doubt its advantages; to exaggerate the unavoidable inequalities of its
operations; to accustom the minds of the people to contemplate the consequences
of a division, as fraught with no dangerous evils; and thus to
</p>
<p>
 lead the way, if not designedly, at least insensibly, to a separation, as
involving no necessary sacrifice of important blessings, or principles, and, on
the whole, under some circumstances, as not undesirable or improbable.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 467.
 </b>
 It is easy to see, how many different, and even
opposite motives may, in different parts of the Union, at different times, give
rise to, and encourage such speculations. Political passions and prejudices,
the disappointments of personal ambition, the excitements and mortifications of
party strife, the struggles for particular systems and measures, the interests,
jealousies, and rivalries of particular states, the unequal local pressure of a
particular system of policy, either temporary or permanent, the honest zeal of
mere theorists and enthusiasts in relation to government, the real or imaginary
dread of a national consolidation, the debasive and corrupt projects of mere
demagogues; these, and many other influences of more or less purity and extent,
may, and we almost fear, must, among a free people, open to argument, and eager
for discussion, and anxious for a more perfect organization of society, for
ever preserve the elements of doubt and discord, and bring into inquiry among
many minds, the question of the value of the Union.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 468.
 </b>
 Under these circumstances it may not be without some
use to condense, in an abridged form, some of those reasons, which became, with
reflecting minds, the solid foundation, on which the adoption of the
constitution was originally vested, and which, being permanent in their nature,
ought to secure its perpetuity, as the sheet anchor of our political hopes. Let
us follow out, then, the suggestion of Mr. Chief Justice Jay, in the passage
already cited.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">
   13
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 § 469. The constitution, then, was adopted first "to form a more
perfect union." Why this was desirable has been in some measure
anticipated in considering the defects of the confederation. When the
constitution, however, was before the people for ratification, suggestions were
frequently made by those, who were opposed to it, that the country was too
extensive for a single national government, and ought to be broken up into
several distinct confederacies, or sovereignties; and some even went so far, as
to doubt, whether it were not, on the whole, best, that each state should
retain a separate, independent, and sovereign political existence.1 Those, who
contemplated several confederacies, speculated upon a dismemberment into three
great confederacies, one of the northern, another of the middle, and a third of
the southern states. The greater probability, certainly, then was of a
separation into two confederacies; the one composed of the northern and middle
states, and the other of the southern. The reasoning of the Federalist on this
subject seems absolutely irresistible.
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 The progress of the population in the
western territory, since that period, has materially changed the basis of all
that reasoning. There could scarcely now, upon any dismemberment, exist, with a
new to local interests, political associations, or public safety, less than
three confederacies, and most probably four. And it is more than probable, that
the line of division would be traced out by geographical boundaries, which
would separate the slave-holding from the non-slave-
</p>
<p>
 holding states. Such a distinction in government is so fraught with causes
of irritation and alarm, that no honest patriot could contemplate it without
many painful and distressing fears.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 470.
 </b>
 But the material consideration, which should be kept
steadily in view, is, that under such circumstances a national government,
clothed with powers at least equally extensive with those given by the
constitution, would be indispensable for the preservation of each separate
confederacy. Nay, it cannot be doubted, that much larger powers, and much
heavier expenditures would be necessary. No nation could long maintain its
public liberties, surrounded by powerful and vigilant neighbours, unless it
possessed a government clothed with powers of great efficiency, prompt to act,
and able to repel every invasion of its rights. Nor would it afford the
slightest security, that all the confederacies were composed of a people
descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the
same religion, attached to the same principles of government, and possessing
similar manners, habits, and customs. If it be true, that these circumstances
would not be sufficient to hold them in a bond of peace and union, when forming
one government, acting for the interests, and as the representatives of the
rights of the whole; how could a better fate be expected, when the interests
and the representation were separate; and ambition, and local interests, and
feelings, and peculiarities of climate, and products, and institutions, and
imaginary or real aggressions and grievances, and the rivalries of commerce,
and the jealousies of dominion, should spread themselves over the distinct
councils, which would regulate their concerns by inde-
</p>
<p>
 pendent legislation?
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
 The experience of the whole world is against any
reliance for security and peace between neighbouring nations, under such
circumstances The Abbe Mably has forcibly stated in a single passage the whole
result of human experience on this subject. " Neighbouring states,"
say he, are naturally enemies of each other, unless their common weakness
forces them to league in a confederative republic; and their constitution
prevents the differences, that neighbourhood occasions, extinguishing that
secret jealousy, which disposes all states to aggrandize themselves at the
expense of their neighbours." This passage, as has been truly observed, at
the same time points out the evil, and suggests the remedy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#16">
   16
  </a>
 </sup>
 § 471. The
same reasoning would apply with augmented force to the case of a dismemberment,
when each state should by itself constitute a nation. The very inequalities in
the size, the revenues, the population, the products, the interests, and even
in the institutions and laws of each, would occasion a perpetual petty warfare
of legislation, of border aggressions and violations, and of political and
personal animosities, which, first or last, would terminate in the subjugation
of the weaker to the arms of the stronger.
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">
   17
  </a>
 </sup>
 In our further observations on this
subject, it is not proposed to distinguish the case of several confederacies
from that of a complete separation of all the states; as in a general sense the
remarks apply with irresistible, if not with uniform, force to each.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 472.
 </b>
 Does, then, the extent of our territory form
</p>
<p>
 any solid objection against forming " this more perfect union? "
This question, so far as respects the original territory included within the
boundaries of the United States by treaty of peace of 1783, seems almost
settled by the experience of the last forty years. It is no longer a matter of
conjecture, how far the government is capable (all other things being equal) of
being practically applied to the whole of that territory. The distance between
the utmost limits of our present population, and the diversity of interests
among the whole, seem to have presented no obstacles under the beneficent
administration of the general government, to the most perfect harmony and
general advancement of all. Perhaps it has been demonstrated, (so far as our
limited experience goes,) that the increased facilities of intercourse, the
uniformity of regulations and laws, the common protection, the mutual
sacrifices of local interests, when incompatible with that of all, and the
pride and confidence m a government, in which all are represented, and all are
equal in rights and privileges; perhaps, we say, it has been demonstrated, that
these effects of the Union have promoted, in a higher degree, the prosperity of
every state, than could have been attained by any single state, standing alone,
in the freest exercise of all its intelligence, its resources, and its
institutions, without any check or obstruction during the same period. The
great change, which has been made in our internal condition, as well as in our
territorial power, by the acquisition of Louisiana and Florida, have, indeed,
given rise to many serious reflections, whether such an expansion of our empire
may not hereafter endanger the original system. But time alone can solve this
question; and to time it is the part of wisdom and patriotism to leave it.
</p>
<p>
 § 473. When, however, the constitution was before the people for
adoption, objections, as has been already suggested, were strenuously urged
against a general government, founded upon the then extent of our territory.
And the authority of Montesquieu was relied on in support of the objections.
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">
   18
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is not a little surprising, that Montesquieu should have been relied on for
this purpose. He obviously had in view, when he recommends a moderate extent of
territory, as best suited to a republic, small states, whose dimensions were
far less than the limits of one half of those in the Union; so that upon
strictly following out his suggestions, the latter ought to have been divided.
But he suggests the appropriate remedy of a confederate republic, (the very
form adopted in the constitution,) as the proper means of at once securing
safety and liberty with extensive territory.
 <sup>
  <a href="#19">
   19
  </a>
 </sup>
 The truth is, that what size is
safe for a nation, with a view to the protection of its rights and liberties,
is a question, which admits of no universal solution. Much depends upon its
local position, its neighbours, its resources, the facilities of invasion, and
of repelling, invasion, the general state of the world, the means and weapons
of warfare, the interests of other nations in preserving or destroying it, and
other circumstances, which scarcely admit of enumeration. How far a republican
government can, in a confederated form, be extended, and be at once efficient
abroad and at home, can ensure general happiness to its own citizens, and
perpetuate the principles of liberty, and preserve the substance of justice, is
a great problem in the
</p>
<p>
 theory of government, which America is now endeavouring, to unfold, and
which, by the blessing of God, we must all earnestly hope, that she may
successfully demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 474.
 </b>
 In the mean time, the following considerations may
serve to cheer our hopes, and dispel our fears. First, (1.) that extent of
territory is not incompatible with a just spirit of patriotism; (2.) nor with a
general representation of all the interests and population within it; (3.) nor
with a due regard to the peculiar local advantages or disadvantages of any
part; (4.) nor with a rapid and convenient circulation of information useful to
all, whether they are rulers or people. On the other hand, it has some
advantages of a very important nature. (1.) It can afford greater protection
against foreign enemies. (2.) It can give a wider range to enterprise and
commerce. (3.) It can secure more thoroughly national independence to all the
great interests of society, agriculture, commerce, manufactures, literature,
learning, religion. (4.) It can more readily disarm and tranquillize domestic
factions in a single state. (5.) It can administer justice more completely and
perfectly. (6.) It can command larger revenues for public objects without
oppression or heavy taxation. (7.) It can economise more in all its internal
arrangements, whenever necessary. In short, as has been said, with equal truth
and force: " One government can collect and avail itself of the talents
and experience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the Union they may be
found. It can move on uniform principles of policy. It can harmonize,
assimilate, and protect the several parts and members, and extend the benefit
of its foresight and precautions to each. In the formation of treaties, it will
regard the interests of the whole, and the par-
</p>
<p>
 ticular interests of the parts, as connected with that of the whole. It can
apply the revenues of the whole to the defence of any particular part, and that
more easily and expeditiously, than state governments or separate confederacies
can possibly do, for want of concert, and unity of system."
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">
   20
  </a>
 </sup>
 Upon some of
these topics, we may enlarge hereafter.
</p>
§ 475. The union of these states, " the more perfect union " is,
then, and must for ever be invaluable to all, in
<p>
 respect both to foreign and domestic concerns. It will prevent some of the
causes of war, that scourge of the human race, by enabling the general
government, not only to negotiate suitable treaties for the protection of the
rights and interests of all, but by compelling a general obedience to them, and
a general respect for the obligations of the law of nations. It is notorious,
that even under the confederation, the obligations of treaty stipulations, were
openly violated, or silently disregarded; and the peace of the whole
confederacy was at the mercy of the majority of any single state. If the states
were separated, they would, or might, form separate and independent treaties
with different nations, according to their peculiar interests. These treaties
would, or might, involve jealousies and rivalries at home, as well as abroad,
and introduce conflicts between nations struggling for a monopoly of the trade
with each state. Retaliatory or evasive stipulations would be made, to
counteract the injurious system of a neighbouring or distant state, and thus
the scene be again acted over with renewed violence, which succeeded the peace
of 1783, when the common interests were forgotten in the general struggle for
superiority. It would manifestly be the interest of foreign nations to promote
these animosities and jealousies, that, in the general weakness, the states
might seek their protection by an undue sacrifice of their interests, or fall
an easy prey to their arms.
 <sup>
  <a href="#21">
   21
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 476.
 </b>
 The dangers, too, to all the states, in case of
division, from foreign wars and invasion, must be imminent, independent of
those from the neighbourhood of the colonies and dependencies of other
governments on this continent. Their very weakness would invite
</p>
<p>
 aggression. The ambition of the European governments, to obtain a mastery
of power in colonies and distant possessions, would be perpetually involving
them in embarrassing negotiations or conflicts, however peaceable might be
their own conduct, and however inoffensive their own pursuits, and objects.
America, as of old, would become the theater of warlike operations, in which
she had no interests; and with a view to their own security, the states would
be compelled to fall back into a general colonial submission, or sink into
dependencies of such of the. great European powers, as might be most favourable
to their interests, or most commanding over their resources.
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 477.
 </b>
 There are also peculiar interests of some of the
states, which would, upon a separation, be wholly sacrificed, or become the
source of immeasurable calamities. The New-England states have a vital interest
in the fisheries with their rivals, England and France; and how could
New-England resist either of these powers in a struggle for the common right,
if attempted to be restrained or abolished? What would become of Maryland and
Virginia, if the Chesapeake were under the dominion of different foreign powers
de facto, though not in form? The free navigation of the Mississippi and the
lakes, and it may be added, the exclusive navigation of them, seems
indispensable to to the security, as well as the prosperity of the western
states. How otherwise, than by a general union, could this be maintained or
guarantied?
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 478.
 </b>
 And again, as to commerce, so important to the
navigating states, and so productive to the agricultural states, it must be at
once perceived, that no adequate pro-
</p>
<p>
 tection could be given to either, unless by the strong and uniform
operations of a general government. Each state by its own regulations would
seek to promote its own interests, to the ruin or injury of those of others.
The relative situation of these states; the number of rivers, by which they are
intersected, and of bays, that wash their shores; the facility of communication
in every direction; the affinity of language and manners; the familiar habits
of intercourse; all these circumstances would conspire to render an illicit
trade between them matter of little difficulty, and would insure frequent
evasions of the commercial regulations of each other.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">
   24
  </a>
 </sup>
 All foreign nations
would have a common interest in crippling us; and all the evils of colonial
servitude, and commercial monopoly would be inflicted upon us, by the hands of
our own kindred and neighbours.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 But this topic, though capable of being
presented in detail from our past experience in such glowing colours, as to
startle the most incredulous into a conviction of the ultimate poverty,
wretchedness, and distress, which would overwhelm every state, does not require
to be more than hinted at. We have already seen in our former examination of
the defects of the confederation, that every state was ruined in its revenues,
as well as in its commerce, by the want of a more efficient government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">
   26
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 479.
 </b>
 Nor should it be imagined, that however injurious to
commerce, the evils would be less in respect to domestic manufactures and
agriculture. In respect to manufactures, the truth is so obvious, that it
requires
</p>
<p>
 no argument to illustrate it. In relation to the agricultural states,
however, an opinion has, at some times and in some sections of the country,
been prevalent, that the agricultural interests would be equally safe without
any general government. The following, among other considerations, may serve to
show the fallacy of all such suggestions. A large and uniform market at home
for native productions has a tendency to prevent those sudden rises and falls
in prices, which are so deeply injurious to the farmer and the planter. The
exclusive possession of the home market against all foreign competition gives a
permanent security to investments, which slowly yield their returns, and
encourages the laying out of capital in agricultural improvements. Suppose
cotton, tobacco, and wheat were at all times admissible from foreign states
without duty, would not the effect be permanently to check any cultivation
beyond what at the moment seems sure of a safe sale? Would not foreign nations
be perpetually tempted to send their surplus here, and thus, from time to time,
depress or glut the home market?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 480.
 </b>
 Again, the neighbouring states would often engage in
the same species of cultivation; and yet with very different natural, or
artificial means of making the products equally cheap. This inequality would
immediately give rise to legislative measures to correct the evil, and to
secure, if possible, superior advantages over the rival state. This would
introduce endless crimination and retaliation, laws for defence, and laws for
offence. Smuggling would be every where openly encouraged, or secretly connived
at. The vital interests of a state would lie in many instances at the mercy of
its neighbours, who might, at the same time,
</p>
<p>
 feel, that their own interests were promoted by the ruin of their
neighbours. And the distant states, knowing, that their own wants and pursuits
were wholly disregarded, would become willing auxiliaries in any plans to
encourage cultivation and consumption elsewhere. Such is human nature! Such are
the infirmities, which history severely instructs us belong to neighbours and
rivals; to those, who navigate, and those, who plant; to those, who desire, and
those, who repine at the prosperity of surrounding states.

 Again; foreign nations, under such circumstances, must
have a common interest, as carriers, to bring to the agricultural states their
own manufactures at as dear a rate as possible, and to depress the market of
the domestic products to the minimum price of competition. They must have a
common interest to stimulate the neighbouring states to a ruinous jealousy; or
by fostering the interests of one, with whom they can deal upon more
advantageous terms, or over whom they have acquired a decisive influence, to
subject to a corresponding influence others, which struggle for an independent
existence.

 This is not mere theory. Examples, and successful examples of this
policy, may be traced though the period between the peace of 1783 and the
adoption of the constitution.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 482.
 </b>
 But not to dwell farther on these important inducements
"to form a more perfect union," let us pass to the next object, which
is to "establish justice." This must for ever be one of the great
ends of every wise government; and even in arbitrary governments it must, to a
great extent, be practiced, at least in respect to private persons, as the only
security against rebel-
</p>
<p>
 lion, private vengeance, and popular cruelty. But in a free government it
lies at the very basis of all its institutions. Without justice being freely,
fully, and impartially administered, neither our persons, nor our rights, nor
our property, can be protected. And if these, or either of them, are regulated
by no certain laws, and are subject to no certain principles, and are held by
no certain tenure, and are redressed, when violated, by no certain remedies,
society fails of all its value; and men may as well return to a state of savage
and barbarous independence. No one can doubt, therefore, that the establishment
of justice must be one main object of all our state governments. Why, then, may
it be asked, should it form so prominent a motive in the establishment of the
national government?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 483
 </b>
 This is now proposed to be shown in a concise manner. In
the administration of justice, foreign nations, and foreign individuals, as
well as citizens, have a deep stake; but the former have not always as complete
means of redress as the latter; for it may be presumed, that the state laws
will always provide adequate tribunals to redress the grievances and sustain
the rights of their own citizens. But this would be a very imperfect view of
the subject. Citizens of contiguous states have a very deep interest in the
administration of justice in each state; and even those, which are most
distant, but belonging to the same confederacy, cannot but be affected by every
inequality in the provisions, or the actual operations of the laws of each
other. While every state remains at full liberty to legislate upon the subject
of rights, preferences, contracts, and remedies, as it may please, it is
scarcely to be expected, that they will all concur in the same general system
of policy. The natural tendency of every
</p>
<p>
 government is to favour its own citizens; and unjust preferences, not only
in the administration of justice, but in the very structure of the laws, may
reasonably be expected to arise. Popular prejudices, or passions, supposed or
real injuries, the predominance of home pursuits and feelings over the
comprehensive views of a liberal jurisprudence, will readily achieve the most
mischievous projects for this purpose. And these, again, by a natural reaction,
will introduce correspondent regulations, and retaliatory measures in other
states.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 483.
 </b>
 Now, exactly what this course of reasoning has led us
to presume as probable, has been demonstrated by experience to be true in
respect to our own confederacy during the short period of its existence, and
under circumstances well calculated to induce each state to sacrifice many of
its own objects for the general good. Nay, even when we were colonies,
dependent upon the authority of the mother country, these inequalities were
observable in the local legislation of several of the states, and produced
heart-burnings and discontents, which were not easily appeased.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 484.
 </b>
 First, in respect to foreign nations. After the
confederacy was formed, and we had assumed the general rights of war as a
sovereign belligerent nation, authority to make captures, and to bring in ships
and cargoes for adjudication naturally flowed from the proper exercise of these
rights by the law of nations. The states respectively retained the power of
appointing prize tribunals, to take cognizance of these matters in the first
instance; and thus thirteen distinct jurisdictions were established, which
acted entirely independent of each other. It is true, that the articles of
confederation had delegated to the general
</p>
<p>
 government the authority of establishing courts for receiving and
determining, finally, appeals in all cases of captures. Congress accordingly
instituted proper appellate tribunals, to which the state courts were
subordinate, and, upon constitutional principles, were bound to yield
obedience. But it is notorious, that the decisions of the appellate tribunals
were disregarded, and treated as mere nullities, for no power to enforce them
was lodged in congress. They operated, therefore, merely by moral influence and
requisition, and, as such, soon sunk into insignificance. Neutral individuals,
as well as neutral nations, were left wholly without any adequate redress for
the most inexcusable injustice, and the confederacy subjected to imminent
hazards. And until the constitution of the United States was established, no
remedy was ever effectually administered.
 <sup>
  <a href="#29">
   29
  </a>
 </sup>
 Treaties, too, were formed by
congress with various nations; and above all, the treaty of peace of 1783,
which gave complete stability to our independence against Great Britain. These
treaties were, by the theory of the confederation, absolutely obligatory upon
all the states. Yet their provisions were notoriously violated both by state
legislation and state judicial tribunals. The non-fulfilment of the
stipulations of the British treaty on our part more than once threatened to
involve the whole country again in war. And the provision in that treaty for
the payment of British debts was practically disregarded in many, if not in
all, the state courts. These debts never were enforced, until the constitution
gave them a direct and adequate
</p>
<p>
 sanction, independently of state legislation and state courts.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 485.
 </b>
 Besides the debts due to foreigners, and the
obligations to pay the same, the public debt of the United States was left
utterly unprovided for; and the officers and soldiers of the revolution, who
had achieved our independence, were, as we have had occasion to notice,
suffered to languish in want, and their just demands evaded, or passed by with
indifference.
 <sup>
  <a href="#31">
   31
  </a>
 </sup>
 No efficient system to pay the public creditors was ever carried
into operation, until the constitution was adopted; and, notwithstanding the
increase of the public debt, occasioned by intermediate wars, it is now on the
very eve of a total extinguishment.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 486.
 </b>
 These evils, whatever might be their magnitude, did not
create so universal a distress, or so much private discontent, as others of a
more domestic nature, which were subversive of the first principles of justice.
Independent of the unjustifiable preferences, which were fostered in favour of
citizens of the state over those belonging to other states, which were not few
nor slight, there were certain calamities inflicted by the common course of
legislation in most of the states, which went to the prostration of all public
faith and all private credit. Laws were constantly made by the state
legislatures violating, with more or less degrees of aggravation, the
sacredness of private contracts. Laws compelling the receipt of a depreciated
</p>
<p>
 and depreciating paper currency in payment of debts were generally, if not
universally, prevalent. Laws authorizing the payment of debts by instalments,
at periods differing entirely from the original terms of the contract; laws
suspending, for a limited or uncertain period, the remedies to recover debts in
the ordinary course of legal proceedings, laws authorizing the delivery of any
sort of property, however unproductive or undesirable, in payment of debts upon
an arbitrary or friendly appraisement; laws shutting up the courts for certain
periods and under certain circumstances, were not infrequent upon the statute
books of many of the states now composing the Union. In the rear of all these
came the systems of general insolvent laws, some of which were of a permanent
nature, and others again were adopted upon the spur of the occasion, like a
sort of gaol delivery under the Lords' acts in England, which hall so few
guards against frauds of every kind by the debtor, that in practice they
amounted to an absolute discharge from any debt, without any thing more than a
nominal dividend; and sometimes even this vain mockery was dispensed with.
 <sup>
  <a href="#32">
   32
  </a>
 </sup>
 In
short, by the operations of paper currency, tender laws, installment laws,
suspension laws, appraisement laws, and insolvent laws, contrived with all the
dexterous ingenuity of men oppressed by debt, and popular by the very extent of
private embarrassments, the states were almost universally plunged into a
ruinous poverty, distrust, debility, and indifference to justice. The local
tribunals were bound to obey the legislative will; and in the few instances, in
which it was resisted, the independence of the judges was sacrificed to the
temper
</p>
<p>
 of the times.
 <sup>
  <a href="#33">

 It is well known, that Shays's rebellion in Massachusetts
took its origin from this source. The object was to prostrate the regular
administration of justice by a system of terror, which should prevent the
recovery of debts and taxes.

 § 487. The Federalist speaks on this subject
with unusual emphasis. "The loss, which America has sustained from the
pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and
man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and
morals of the people, and on the character of republican government,
constitutes an enormous debt against the states, chargeable with this unadvised
measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of
guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the
altar of justice of the power; which has been the instrument of it."

 "Laws impairing the obligation of contracts are contrary to the first
principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound
legislation."
 <sup>
  <a href="#36">

  </a>
 </sup>
 And the Federalist dwells on the suggestion, that as such
laws amount to an aggression on the rights of the citizens of those states,
whose citizens are injured by them, they must necessarily form a probable
source of hostilities among the states. Connecticut retaliated in an exem-
</p>
<p>
 plary manner upon enormities of this sort, which she thought had been
perpetrated by a neighbouring state upon the just rights of her citizens.
Indeed, war constitutes almost the only remedy to chastise atrocious breaches
of moral obligations, and social justice in respect to debts and other
contracts."

</p>
§ 489. The next clause in the preamble is "to ensure domestic
tranquillity." The illustrations appropriate to this head have been in a
great measure anticipated in our previous observations. The security of the
states against foreign influence, domestic dissensions, commercial rivalries,
legislative retaliations, territorial disputes, and the petty irritations of a
border warfare for privileges, exemptions, and smuggling, have been already
noticed.
<sup>
 <a href="#39">
  39
 </a>
</sup>
The very habits of intercourse, to which the states were accustomed
with each other during their colonial state, would, as has been justly
remarked, give a keener edge to every discontent excited by any inequalities,
preferences, or exclusions, growing out of the public policy of any of them.
<sup>
 <a href="#40">
  40
 </a>
</sup>
These, however, are not the only evils. In small communities domestic factions
may well be expected to arise, which, when honest, may lead to the most
pernicious public measures; and when corrupt, to domestic insurrections, and
even to an overthrow of the government. The dangers to a republican government
from this source have been dwelt upon by the advocates of arbitrary government
with much exultation; and it must be confessed, that the history of free
governments has furnished but too many examples to apologize for, though not to
justify their arguments, drawn not only against the forms of republican
government, but against the principles of civil liberty. They have pointed out
the brief duration of republics, the factions, by which they have been rent,
and the miseries, which they have suffered from distracted councils, and
time-serving policy,
and popular fury, and corruption, in a manner calculated to increase the
solicitude of every well-wisher to the cause of rational liberty. And even
those, who are most favourable in their views, seem to have thought, that the
experience of the world had never yet furnished any conclusive proofs in its
support.
<sup>
 <a href="#41">
  41
 </a>
</sup>
We know but too well, that factions have been the special growth of
republics. By a faction, we are to understand a number of citizens, whether
amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united by some common
impulse of passion, or interest, or party, adverse to the rights of the other
citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

<p>
 <b>
  § 490.
 </b>
 The latent causes of faction seem sown in the nature of
man. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, and government, and
many other points, both of speculation and practice; an attachment to different
leaders; mutual rivalries and animosities; the restlessness of ambition; the
pride of opinion; the desire for popular favour; commonly supply a ready origin
to factions. And where deeper causes are not at work, the most trivial
differences, and the most accidental circumstances, occasionally excite the
most severe conflicts. But the most durable, as well as the most alarming form,
in which faction has displayed itself, has grown out of the unequal
distribution of property. Those, who have, and those, who have not property,
have, and must for ever have, distinct interests in society. The relation of
debtor and creditor, at all times delicate, sometimes assumes a shape, which
threatens the overthrow of the government itself.

 <b>
  § 491.
 </b>
 There are but two methods of curing the mischiefs of
faction; the one, by removing its causes,
</p>
<p>
 which, in a free government, is impracticable without the destruction of
liberty; the other, by controlling its effects. If a faction be a minority, the
majority may apply the proper corrective, by defeating or checking the violence
of the minority in the regular course of legislation. In small states, however,
this is not always easily attainable, from the difficulty of combining in a
permanent form sufficient influence for this purpose. A feeble domestic faction
will naturally avail itself, not only of all accidental causes of
dissatisfaction at home, but also of all foreign aid and influence to carry its
projects. And, indeed, in the gradual operations of factions, so many
combinations are formed and dissolved, so many private resentments become
embodied in public measures, and success and triumph so often follow after
defeat, that the remnants of different factions, which have had a brief sway,
however hostile to each other, have an interest to unite in order to put down
their rivals. But if the faction be a majority, and stand unchecked, except by
its own sense of duty, or its own fears, the dangers are imminent to all those,
whose principles, or interests, or characters stand in the way of their supreme
dominion.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 492.
 </b>
 These evils are felt in great states; but it has been
justly observed, that in small states they are far more aggravated, bitter,
cruel, and permanent. The most effectual means to control such effects seem to
be in the formation of a confederate republic, consisting of several states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#45">
   45

 </sup>
 It will be rare, under such circumstances, if proper powers are confided to the
general government, that the state line does not form the natural, as it will
the jurisdictional boundary of the opera-
</p>
<p>
 tions of factions. The authority of the general government will have a
natural tendency to suppress the violence of faction, by diminishing the
chances of ultimate success; and the example of the neighbouring states, who
will rarely, at the same time, partake of the same feelings, or have the same
causes to excite them into action, will mitigate, if it does not wholly disarm,
the violence of the predominant faction.
 <sup>
  <a href="#46">
   46
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 493.
 </b>
 One of the ordinary results of disunion among
neighbouring states is the necessity of creating and keeping up standing
armies, and other institutions unfavourable to liberty. The immediate dangers
from sudden inroads and invasions, and the perpetual jealousies and discords
incident to their local position, compel them to resort to the establishment of
armed forces, either disproportionate to their means, or inadequate for their
defence. Either alternative is fraught with public mischiefs. If they do not
possess an adequate military force to repel invasion, they have no security
against aggression and insult. If they possess an adequate military force,
there is much reason to dread, that it may, in the hands of aspiring or corrupt
men, become the means of their subjugation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#47">
   47
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is no other refuge in such
cases, but to seek an alliance always unequal, and to be obtained only by
important concessions to some powerful nation, or to form a confederacy with
other states, and thus to secure the co-operation and the terror of numbers.
Nothing has so strong a tendency to suppress hostile enterprises, as the
consciousness, that they will not be easily successful. Nothing is so sure to
produce moderation, as the consciousness, that resistance will steadily
maintain the
</p>
<p>
 dictates of justice. Summary, nay, even arbitrary authority, must be
granted, where the safety of a state cannot await the slow measures of ordinary
legislation to protect it. That government is, therefore, most safe in its
liberties, as well as in its domestic peace, whose numbers constitute a
preventive guard against all internal, as well as external attacks.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 494.
 </b>
 We now proceed to the next clause in the preamble, to
"provide for the common defence." And many of the considerations
already stated apply with still greater force under this head. One of the
surest means of preserving peace is said to be, by being always prepared for
war. But a still more sure means is the power to repel, with effect, every
aggression. That power can scarcely be attained without a wide extent of
population, and at least a moderate extent of territory. A country, which is
large in its limits, even if thinly peopled, is not easily subdued. Its variety
of soil and climate, its natural and artificial defences, nay, its very poverty
and scantiness of supplies, make it difficult to gain, or to secure a permanent
conquest. It is far easier to overrun, than to subdue it. Armies must be
divided, distant posts must be maintained, and channels of supplies kept
constantly open. But where the territory is not only large, but populous,
permanent conquest can rarely occur, unless (which is not our case) there are
very powerful neighbours on every side, having a common interest to assist each
other, and to subjugate their enemy. It is far otherwise, where there are many
rival and independent states, having no common union of government or
interests. They are half subdued by their own dissensions, jealousies, and
resentments before the conflict is begun. They are easily made to act a part in
the destruction of each other, or
</p>
easily fall a prey for want of proper concert and energy of operations.
<p>
 <b>
  § 495.
 </b>
 Besides; -- The resources of a confederacy must be far greater
than those of any single state belonging to it, both for peace and war. It can
command a wider range of revenue, of military power, of naval armaments, and of
productive industry. It is more independent in its employments, in its
capacities, and in its influences. In the present state of the world, a few
great powers possess the command of commerce, both on land and at sea. In war,
they trample upon the rights of neutrals who are feeble; for their weakness
furnishes an excuse both for servility and disdain. In peace, they control the
pursuits of the rest of the world, and force their trade into every channel by
the activity of their enterprise, their extensive navigation, and their
flourishing manufactures. They little regard the complaints of those, who are
subvided into petty states with varying interests; and use them only as
instruments to annoy or check the enterprise of each other. Such states are not
formidable in peace or in war. To secure their rights and maintain their
independence they must become a confederated nation, and speak with the force
of numbers, as well as the eloquence of truth.
 <sup>
  <a href="#48">
   48
  </a>
 </sup>
 The navy or army, which could
be maintained by any single state in the Union, would be scarcely formidable to
any second rate power in Europe. It would be a grievous public burthen, and
exhaust the whole resources of the state. But a navy or army for all the
purposes of home defence, or protection upon the ocean, is within the compass
of the resources of the general government, without any severe exaction. And
</p>
with the growing strength of the Union must be at once more safe for us, and
more formidable to foreign nations. The means, therefore, to provide for the
common defence are ample; and they can only be rendered inert and inadequate by
a division among the states, and a want of unity of operations.
<sup>
 <a href="#49">

 </a>
</sup>
<p>
 <b>
  §
496.
 </b>
 We pass, in the next place, to the clause to "promote the general
welfare." And it may be asked, as the state governments are formed for the
same purpose by the people, why should this be set forth, as a peculiar or
prominent object of the constitution of the United States? To such an inquiry
two general answers may be given. The states, separately, would not possess the
means. If they did possess the means, they would not possess the power to carry
the appropriate measures into operation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 497.
 </b>
 First, in respect to means. It is obvious, that from
the local position and size of several of the states, they must for ever
possess but a moderate revenue, not more than what is indispensable for their
own wants, and, in the strictest sense, for domestic improvements. In relation
to others more favourably situated for commerce and navigation, the revenues
from taxation may be larger; but the main reliance must be placed upon the
taxation by way of imposts upon importations. Now, it is obvious, from the
remarks already made, that no permanent revenue can be raised from this source,
when the states are separated. The evasions of the laws, which will constantly
take place from the rivalries, and various interests of the neighbouring
states; the facilities afforded by the numerous harbours, rivers, and bays,
which indent and intersect our coasts; the strong
</p>
<p>
 interest of foreigners to promote smuggling; the want of uniformity in the
duties laid by the different states; the means of intercourse along the
internal territorial boundaries of the commercial states; these, and many other
causes, would inevitably lead to a very feeble administration of any local
revenue system, and would make its returns moderate and unsatisfactory. What
could New-York do with a single sea-port, surrounded on each side by jealous
maritime neighbours with numerous ports? What could Massachusetts, or
Connecticut do with the intermediate territory of RhodeIsland, running into the
heart of the states by water communications admirably adapted for the security
of illicit trade? What could Maryland or Virginia do with the broad Chesapeake
between them with its thousand landing places? What could Pennsylvania oppose
to the keen resentments, or the facile policy of her weaker neighbour,
Delaware? What could any single state on the Mississippi do to force a steady
trade for itself with adequate protecting duties? In short, turn to whichever
part of the continent we may, the difficulties of maintaining an adequate
system of revenue would be insurmountable, and the expenses of collecting it
enormous. After some few struggles for uniformity, and co-operation for mutual
support, each state would sink back into listless indifference or gloomy
despondency; and rely, principally, upon direct taxation for its ordinary
supplies.
 <sup>
  <a href="#50">
   50
  </a>
 </sup>
 The experience of the few years succeeding the peace of 1783 fully
justifies the worst apprehensions on this head.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 498
 </b>
 On the other hand, a general government, clothed with
suitable authority over all the states, could
</p>
<p>
 easily guard the whole Atlantic coast, and make it the interest of all
honourable merchants to assist in a regular and punctilious payment of duties.
Vessels arriving at different ports of the Union would rarely choose to expose
themselves to the perils of seizure, not in a single state only, but in every
state, into which the goods might be successively imported. The dangers upon
the coast, from the vigilant operations of the revenue officers and revenue
vessels, would be great; and they would be much enhanced by the expenses of
concealment after the goods were landed.
 <sup>
  <a href="#51">
   51
  </a>
 </sup>
 And the fact has corresponded with
the theory. Since the establishment of the national government, there has been
comparatively little smuggling on our coasts; and the revenue from the duties
upon importations has steadily increased with the development of the other
resources of the country.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 499.
 </b>
 And this leads us to remark, in the next place, that
the establishment of a general government is not only beneficial, as a source
of revenue, but as a means of economy in its collection, distribution, and
expenditure. Instead of a large civil list for each state, which shall be
competent of itself to discharge all the functions applicable to a sovereign
nation, a comparatively small one for the whole nation will suffice to carry
into effect its powers, and to receive and disburse its revenues. Besides the
economy in the civil department, we have already seen, how much less actual
expenditures will be necessary for the military and naval departments, for the
security of all the states, than would be, if each were compelled to maintain
at all points its independent sovereignty. No fortifications,
</p>
<p>
 no commanding posts, no naval flotilla will be necessary to guard the
states against each other; nor any corps of officers to protect the frontiers
of each against invasion, or smuggling. The exterior boundary of the whole
Union will be that alone, which will require to be protected at the national
expense.
 <sup>
  <a href="#52">
   52
  </a>
 </sup>
 Besides; there will be a uniformity of operations and arrangements
upon all subjects of the common welfare under the guidance of a single head;
instead of multifarious, and often conflicting systems by distinct states.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 500.
 </b>
 But if the means were completely within the power of
the several states, it is obvious, that the jurisdiction would be wanting to
carry into effect any great or comprehensive plan for the welfare of the whole.
The idea of a permanent and zealous co-operation of thirteen (and now of
twenty-four) distinct governments in any scheme for the common welfare, is of
itself a visionary notion. In the first place, laying aside all local
jealousies and accidental jars, there is no plan for the benefit of the whole,
which would not bear unequally upon some particular parts. Is it a regulation
of commerce or mutual intercourse, which is proposed? Who does not see, that
the agricultural, the manufacturing, and the navigating states, may have a real
or supposed difference of interest in its adoption. If a system of regulations,
on the other hand, is prepared by a general government, the inequalities of one
part may, and ordinarily will, under the guidance of wise councils, correct and
meliorate those of another. The necessity of a sacrifice of one for the benefit
of all may not, and probably will not, be felt at the moment by the state
called upon to make it. But in a general govern-
</p>
<p>
 ment, representing the interests of all, the sacrifice, though first
opposed, will, in the end, be found adequately recompensed by other substantial
good. Agriculture, commerce, manufactures, may, each in turn, be compelled to
yield something of their peculiar benefits, and yet, on the whole, be still
each a gainer by the general system. The very power of thus redressing the
evils, felt by each in its intercourse with foreign nations, by prohibitory
regulations, or countervailing duties, may secure permanent privileges of an
incalculable value.
 <sup>
  <a href="#53">
   53
  </a>
 </sup>
 And the fact has been, as theoretical reasoning would lead
us to suppose. The navigation and commerce, the agriculture and manufactures of
all the states, have received an advancement in every direction by the union,
which has far exceeded the most sanguine expectation of its warmest friends.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 501.
 </b>
 But the fact alone of an unlimited intercourse, without
duty or restriction, between all the states, is of itself a blessing of almost
inconceivable value. It makes it an object with each permanently to look to the
interests of all, and to withdraw its operations from the narrow sphere of its
own exclusive territory. Without entering here into the inquiry, how far the
general government possesses the power to make, or aid the making of roads,
canals, and other general improvements, which will properly arise in our future
discussions, it is clear, that if there were no general government, the
interest of each state to undertake, or to promote in its own legislation any
such project, would be far less strong, than it now is; since there would be no
certainty, as to the value or duration of such improvements, looking beyond the
boundaries of the state.
</p>
<p>
 The consciousness, that the union of the states is permanent, and will not
be broken up by rivalries, or conflicts of policy, that caprice, or resentment,
will not divert any state from its proper duties, as a member of the Union,
will give a solid character to all improvements. Independent of the exercise of
any authority by the general government for this purpose, it was justly
foreseen, that roads would be every where shortened and kept in better order;
accommodations for travellers would be multiplied and meliorated; an interior
navigation on our eastern side would be opened throughout the whole extent of
our coast; and, by canals and improvements in river navigation, a boundless
field opened to enterprise and emigration, to commerce and products, through
the interior states, to the farthest limits of our western territories.

  § 502.
 </b>
 Passing from these general considerations to those of a
direct practical nature, let us see, how far certain measures, confessedly
promotive of the general welfare, have been, or would be, affected by a
disunion of the states. Take, for example, the post-office establishment, the
benefits of which can scarcely be too strongly stated in respect to the public
interests, or to private convenience. With what a wonderful facility it now
communicates intelligence, and transmits orders and directions, and money and
negotiable paper to every extremity of the Union. The government is enabled to
give the most prompt notice of approaching dangers, of its commands, its
wishes, its duties, its interests, its laws, and its policy, to the most
distant functionaries with incredible speed. Compare this with the old course
of private posts, and special expresses. Look
</p>
<p>
 to the extensive advantages to trade, navigation, and commerce, to
agriculture and manufactures, in the ready distribution of news, of knowledge
of markets, and of transfers of funds, independent of the inestimable blessings
of communication between distant friends, to relieve the heart from its
oppressive anxieties. In our colonial state it took almost as long a period of
time to convey a letter (independent of the insecurity and uncertainty of its
transmission) from Philadelphia to Boston, as it now takes to pass from the
seat of government to the farthest limits of any of the states. Even under the
confederation, from the want of efficient funds and an efficient government,
the post moved on with a tardy indifference and delay, which made it almost
useless. We now communicate with England, and the continents of Europe, within
periods not essentially different from those, which were then consumed in
passing from the centre to the eastern and southern limits of the Union.
Suppose the national government were now dissolved, how difficult would it be
to get the twenty-four states to agree upon any uniform system of operations,
or proper apportionment of the postage to be paid on the transmission of the
mail. Each state must act continually by a separate legislation; and the least
change by any one would disturb the harmony of the whole system. It is not at
all improbable, that before a single letter could reach NewOrleans from
Eastport, it would have to pay a distinct postage in sixteen independent
states, subject to no common control or appointment of officers. The very
statement of such a case amounts to a positive prohibition upon any extensive
internal intercourse by the mail, as the burthens and the insecurity of the
establishment would render it intolerable. With what admi-
</p>
<p>
 rable ease, and expedition, and noiseless uniformity of movement, is the
whole now accomplished through the instrumentality of the national government!
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 503.
 </b>
 Let us take another example, drawn from the perils of
navigation; and ask ourselves, how it would be possible, without an efficient
national government, to provide adequately for the erection and support of
light-houses, monuments, buoys, and other guards against shipwreck. Many of
these are maintained at an expense wholly disproportionate to their advantage
to the state, in which they are situate. Many of them never would be
maintained, except for the provident forecast of a national government, intent
on the good of the whole, and possessing powers adequate to secure it. The same
considerations apply to all measures of internal improvement, either to
navigation by removing obstructions in rivers and inlets, or by erecting
fortifications for purposes of defence, and to guard our harbours against the
inroads of enemies.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 504.
 </b>
 Independent of these means of promoting the general
welfare, we shall at once see, in our negotiations with foreign powers, the
vast superiority of a nation combining numbers and resources over states of
small extent, and divided by different interests. If we are to negotiate for
commercial or other advantages, the national government has more authority to
speak, as well as more power to influence, than can belong to a single state.
It has more valuable privileges to give in exchange, and more means of making
those privileges felt by prohibitions, or relaxations of its commercial
legislation. Is money wanted; how much more easy and cheap to borrow-upon the
faith of a nation competent to pay, than of a single state of fluctuating
policy. Is confidence asked for the faithful fulfilment
</p>
<p>
 of treaty stipulations; how much more strong the guaranty of the Union with
suitable authorities, than any pledge of an individual state. Is a currency
wanted at once fixed on a solid basis, and sustained by adequate sanctions to
enlarge public or private credit; how much more decisive is the legislation of
the Union, than of a single state with a view to extent, or uniformity of
operations.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 505.
 </b>
 Thus we see, that the national government, suitably
organized, has more efficient means, and more extensive jurisdiction to promote
the general welfare, than can belong to any single state of the confederacy.
And there is much truth in the suggestion, that it will generally be directed
by a more enlightened policy, a more liberal justice, and more comprehensive
wisdom, in the application of its means and its powers to their appropriate
end. Generally speaking, it will be better administered; because it will
command higher talents, more extensive experience, more practical knowledge,
and more various information of the wants of the whole community, than can
belong to smaller societies.
 <sup>
  <a href="#55">

  </a>
 </sup>
 The wider the sphere of action, the less reason
there is to presume, that narrow views, or local prejudices will prevail in the
public councils. The very diversities of opinion in the different
representatives of distant regions will have a tendency, not only to introduce
mutual concession and conciliation, but to elevate the policy, and instruct the
judgment of those, who are to direct the public measures.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 506.
 </b>
 The last clause in the preamble is to "secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." And surely no object
could be more worthy of the wisdom and ambition of the best men in any age. If
there
</p>
<p>
 be any thing, which may justly challenge the admiration of all mankind, it
is that sublime patriotism, which, looking beyond its own times? and its own
fleeting pursuits, aims to secure the permanent happiness of posterity by
laying the broad foundations of government upon immovable principles of
justice. Our affections, indeed, may naturally be presumed to outlive the brief
limits of our own lives, and to repose with deep sensibility upon our own
immediate descendants. But there is a noble disinterestedness in that forecast,
which disregards present objects for the sake of all mankind, and erects
structures to protect, support, and bless the most distant generations. He, who
founds a hospital, a college, or even a more private and limited charity, is
justly esteemed a benefactor of the human race. How much more do they deserve
our reverence and praise, whose lives are devoted to the formation of
institutions, which, when they and their children are mingled in the common
dust, may continue to cherish the principles and the practice of liberty in
perpetual freshness and vigour.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 507.
 </b>
 The grand design of the state governments is,
doubtless, to accomplish this important purpose; and there can be no doubt,
that they are, when well administered, well adapted to the end. But the
question is not so much, whether they conduce to the preservation of the
blessings of liberty, as whether they of themselves furnish a complete and
satisfactory security. If the remarks, which have been already offered, are
founded in sound reasoning and human experience, they establish the position,
that the state governments, per se, are incompetent and inadequate to furnish
such guards and guaranties, as a free people have a right to require for the
maintenance of their vital interests, and especially
</p>
<p>
 of their liberty. The inquiry then naturally presents itself, whether the
establishment of a national government will afford more effectual and adequate
securities.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 508.
 </b>
 The fact has been already adverted to, that when the
constitution was before the people for adoption, it was generally represented
by its opponents, that its obvious tendency to a consolidation of the powers of
government would subvert the state sovereignties, and thus prove dangerous to
the liberties of the people.
 <sup>
  <a href="#56">
   56
  </a>
 </sup>
 This indeed was a topic dwelt on with peculiar
emphasis; and it produced so general an alarm and terror, that it came very
nigh accomplishing the rejection of the constitution.
 <sup>
  <a href="#57">
   57
  </a>
 </sup>
 And yet the reasoning,
by which it was supported, was so vague and unsatisfactory; and the reasoning,
on the other side, was so cogent and just, that it seems difficult to conceive,
how, at that time, or at any later time, (for it has often been resorted to for
the same purpose,) the suggestion could have had any substantial influence upon
the public opinion.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 509.
 </b>
 Let us glance at a few considerations, (some of which
have been already hinted at,) which are calculated to suppress all alarm upon
this subject. In the first place, the government of the United States is one of
limited powers, leaving all residuary general powers in the state governments,
or in the people thereof. The jurisdiction of the general government is
confined to a few enumerated objects, which concern the common welfare of all
the states. The state governments have a full superintendence and control over
the immense mass of local interests of their respective states, which con-
</p>
<p>
 nect themselves with the feelings, the affections, the municipal
institutions, and the internal arrangements of the whole population.
 <sup>
  <a href="#58">
   58
  </a>
 </sup>
 They
possess, too, the immediate administration of justice in all cases, civil and
criminal, which concern the property, personal rights, and peaceful pursuits of
their own citizens. They must of course possess a large share of influence; and
being independent of each other, will have many opportunities to interpose
checks, as well as to combine a common resistance, to any undue exercise of
power by the general government, independent of direct force.
 <sup>
  <a href="#59">
   59
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 510.
 </b>
 In the next place, the state governments are, by the
very theory of the constitution, essential constituent parts of the general
government. They can exist without the latter, but the latter cannot exist
without them. Without the intervention of the state legislatures, the president
of the United States cannot be elected at all; and the senate is exclusively
and absolutely under the choice of the state legislatures. The representatives
are chosen by the people of the states. So that the executive and legislative
branches of the national government depend upon, and emanate from the states.
Every where the state sovereignties are represented; and the national
sovereignty, as such, has no representation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#60">
   60
  </a>
 </sup>
 How is it possible, under such
circumstances, that the national government can be dangerous to the liberties
of the people, unless the states, and the people of the states, conspire
together for their overthrow? If there should be such a conspiracy, is not this
more justly to be deemed an act of the states through their own agents, and by
their own choice, rather than a corrupt usurpation by the general government?
</p>
<p>
 § 511. Besides; the perpetual organization of the state governments,
in all their departments, executive, legislative, and judicial; their natural
tendency to cooperation in cases of threatened danger to their common
liberties; the perpetually recurring right of the elective franchise, at short
intervals, must prevent the most formidable barriers against any deliberate
usurpation, which does not arise from the hearty co-operation of the people of
the states. And when such a general co-operation for usurpation shall exist, it
is obvious, that neither the general, nor the state governments, can interpose
any permanent protection. Each must submit to that public will, which created,
and may destroy them.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 512.
 </b>
 Another not unimportant consideration is, that the
powers of the general government will be, and indeed must be, principally
employed upon external objects, such as war, peace, negotiations with foreign
powers, and foreign commerce. In its internal operations it can touch but few
objects, except to introduce regulations beneficial to the commerce,
intercourse, and other relations, between the states, and to lay taxes for the
common good. The powers of the states, on the other hand, extend to all
objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, and
liberties, and property of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and
prosperity of the state. The operations of the general government will be most
extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the state
governments, in times of peace and security.
 <sup>
  <a href="#61">
   61
  </a>
 </sup>
 Independent of all other
considerations, the fact, that the states possess a concurrent power of
taxation, and an
</p>
exclusive power to regulate the descents, devise, and distribution of estates,
(a power the most formidable to despotism, and the most indispensable in its
night exercise to republicanism,) will for ever give them an influence, which
will be as commanding, as, with reference to the safety of the Un on, they
could deliberately desire.
<sup>
 <a href="#62">
  62
 </a>
</sup>
<p>
 <b>
  § 513.
 </b>
 Indeed, the constant
apprehension of some of the most sincere patriots, who by their wisdom have
graced our country, has been of an opposite character. They have believed, that
the states would, in the event, prove too formidable for the Union. That the
tendency would be to anarchy in the members, and not to tyranny in the head.
 <sup>
  <a href="#63">
   63
  </a>
 </sup>
 Whether their fears, in this respect, were not those of men, whose judgments
were misled by extreme solicitude for the welfare of their country, or whether
they but too well read the fate of our own in the history of other republics,
time, the great expounder of such problems, can alone determine.
 <sup>
  <a href="#64">
   64
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 The reasoning on this subject, which has been with so much profoundness and
ability advanced by the Federalist, will, in the mean time, deserve the
attention of every considerate man in America.1
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 514.
 </b>
 Hitherto our experience has demonstrated the entire
safety of the states, under the benign operations of the constitution. Each of
the states has grown in power, in vigour of operation, in commanding influence,
in wealth, revenue, population, commerce, agriculture, and general efficiency.
No man will venture to affirm, that their power, relative to that of the Union,
has been diminished, although our population has, in the intermediate period,
passed from three to more than twelve millions. No man will pretend to say,
that the affection for the state governments has been sensibly diminished by
the operations of the general government. If the latter has become more deeply
an object of regard and reverence, of attachment and pride, it is, because it
is felt to be the parental guardian of our public and private rights, and the
natural ally of all the state governments, in the administration of justice,
and the promotion of the general prosperity. It is beloved, not for its power,
but for its beneficence; not because it commands, but because it protects; not
because it controls, but because it sustains the common interests, and the
common liberties, and the common lights of the people.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 515.
 </b>
 That there have been measures adopted by the general
government, which have not met with universal approbation, must be admitted.
But was not this
</p>
<p>
 difference of opinion to be expected? Does it not exist in relation to the
acts of the state governments? Must it not exist in every government, formed
and directed by human beings of different talents, characters, passions,
virtues, motives, and intelligence? That some of the measures of the general
government have been deemed usurpations by some of the states is also true. But
it is equally true, that those measures were deemed constitutional by a
majority of the states, and as such, received the most hearty concurrence of
the state authorities. It is also true, that some measures, whose
constitutionality has been doubted or denied by some states, have, at other
times, upon re-examination, been approved of by the same states. Not a single
measure has ever induced three quarters of the states to adopt any amendment to
the constitution founded upon the notion of usurpation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#65">
   65
  </a>
 </sup>
 Wherever an amendment
has taken place, it has been to clear a real doubt, or obviate an inconvenience
established by our experience. And this very power of amendment, at the command
of the states themselves, forms the great balance-wheel of our system; and
enables us silently and quietly to redress all irregularities, and to put down
all practical oppressions. And what is not a little remarkable in the history
of the government, is, that two measures, which stand confessedly upon the
extreme limits of constitutional authority, and carry the doctrine of
constructive power to the last verge, have been brought forward by those, who
were the opponents of the constitution, or the known advocates for its most
restricted construc-
</p>
<p>
 tion. In each case, however, they received the decided support of a great
majority of all the states of the Union; and the constitutionality of them is
now universally acquiesced in, if not universally affirmed. We allude to the
unlimited embargo, passed in 1807, and the purchase and admission of Louisiana
into the Union, under the treaty with France in 1803.
 <sup>
  <a href="#66">
   66
  </a>
 </sup>
 That any act has ever
been done by the general government, which even a majority of the states in the
Union have deemed a clear and gross usurpation, may be safely denied. On the
other hand, it is certain, that many powers positively belonging to the general
government, have never yet been put into full operation. So that the influence
of state opinions, and state jealousies, and state policy, may be clearly
traced throughout the operations of the general government, and especially in
the exercise of the legislative powers. This furnishes no just ground of
complaint or accusation. It is right, that it should be so. But it
demonstrates, that the general government has many salutary checks, silently at
work to control its movements; and, that experience coincides with theory in
establishing, that it is calculated to secure " the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and our posterity."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 516.
 </b>
 If, upon a closer survey of all the powers given by the
constitution, and all the guards upon their exercise, we shall perceive still
stronger inducements
</p>
<p>
 to fortify this conclusion, and to increase our confidence in the
constitution, may we not justly hope, that every honest American will concur in
the dying expression of Father Paul, " Esto perpetua," may it be
perpetual.

51, present the subject of the advantages of the Union in a striking light:
"There are, moreover, two considerations particularly applicable to the
federal system of America, which place it in a very interesting point of view.
    
     " First: In a single republic, all the power surrendered by the people
is submitted to the administration of a single government; and the usurpations
are guarded against by a division of the government into distinct and separate
departments. In the compound republic of America, the power surrendered by the
people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion
allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate. departments. Hence a
double security arises to the rights of the people. The different governments
will control each other; at the same time that each will be controlled by
itself. "Secondly: It is of great importance in a republic, not only to guard
the society against the oppression of its rulers; but to guard one part of the
society against the injustice of the other part. Different interests
necessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a majority be united by
a common interest, the rights of the minority will be insecure. There are but
two methods of providing against this evil: The one by creating a will in the
community independent of the majority, that is, of the society itself; the
other, by comprehending in the society so many separate descriptions of
citizens, as will render an unjust combination of a majority of the whole very
improbable, if not impracticable. The first method prevails in all governments
possessing an hereditary, or selfappointed authority. This, at best, is but a
precarious security; because A power, independent of the society, may as well
espouse the unjust views of the major, as the rightful interests of the minor
party, and may possibly be turned against both parties. The second method will
be exemplified in the federal republic of the United States. Whilst all
authority in it will be derived from, and dependent on the society, the society
itself will be broken into many parts, interests, and classes of citizens. that
the rights of individuals. or of the minority, will be in little danger from
interested combinations of the majority. In a free government the security for
civil rights must be the same, as that for religious rights. It consists, in
the one case in the multiplicity of interests and  in the other, in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both
cases will depend on the number of interests and sects; and this may be
presumed to depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended
under the same government. This view of the subject must particularly recommend
a proper federal system to all the sincere and considerate friends of
republican government; since it shows, that in exact proportion, as the
territory of the Union may be formed into more circumscribed confederacies, of
states, oppressive combinations of a majority will be facilitated; the best
security under the republican form, for the rights of every class of citizens,
will be diminished; and consequently. the stability and independence of some
member of the government, the only other security, must be proportionably
increased, Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It
ever has been, and ever will be, pursued, until it be obtained, or until
liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society, under the forms of which the
stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly
be said to reign, as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not
secured against the violence of the stronger. And, as in the latter state, even
the stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their condition to
submit to a government, which may protect the weak, as well as themselves: so,
in the former state, will the more powerful factions be gradually induced, by a
like motive, to wish for a government, which will protect all parties, the
weaker, as well as the more powerful. It can be little doubted, that if the
state of Rhode-Island was separated from the confederacy, and left to itself,
the insecurity of rights, under the popular form of government within such
narrow limits, would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of the
factious majorities, that some power, altogether independent of the people,
would soon be called for by the voice of the very factions, whose misrule had
proved the necessity of it. In the extended republic of the United States, and
among the great variety of interests, parties, and sects which it embraces, a
coalition of a majority of the whole society could seldom take place upon any
other principles, than those of justice, and the general good; whilst there
being thus less danger to a minor, from the will of the major party, there must
be less pretext also to provide for the security of the former, by introducing
into the government a will not dependent on the latter; or, in other words, a
will independent of the society itself. It is no less certain, that it is
important, notwithstanding the contrary opinions, which have been entertained,
that the larger the society, provided it lie within a practicable sphere, the
more duly capable it will be of self-government. And happily for the republican
cause, the practicable sphere may be carried to a very great extent, by a
judicious modification and mixture of the federal principle."</li>

<li><a id="33"></a> The case of Trevett v. Welden, in 1786, in Rhode-Island, is an instance
of this sort, which is in point, and illustrates the text, though it would not
be difficult to draw others from states of larger extent. The judges in that
case decided, that a law making paper money a tender in payment of debts was
unconstitutional, and against the principles of magna charta. They were
compelled to appear before the legislature to vindicate themselves; and the
next year (being chosen annually) they were left out of office for questioning
the legislative power.</li>

<li><a id="38"></a> The remarks of Mr. Chief Justice Jay in Chisholm v. Georgia,(2 Dall. R. 419,
474; S. C. 2 Peters's Cond. R. 635, 670,) illustrate the truth of these
reasonings in an interesting manner. " Prior to the date," says he.
" of the constitution, the people had not any national tribunal, to which
they could resort for justice; the distribution of justice was then confined to
state judicatories, in whose institution and organization the people of the
other states had no participation, and over whom they had not the least
control. There was then no general court of appellate jurisdiction, by whom the
errors of state courts, affecting either the nation at large, or the citizens
of any other state, could be revised and corrected. Each state was obliged to
acquiesce in the measure of justice, which another state might yield to her, or
to her citizens; and that, even in cases where state considerations were not
always favourable to the most exact measure. There was danger, that from this
source animosities would in time result; and as the transition from animosities
to hostilities was frequent in the history of independent states, a common
tribunal for the termination of controversies became desirable, from motives
both of justice and of policy.
      
       "Prior also to that period, the United
States had, by taking a place among the nations of the earth, become amenable
to the laws of nations; and it was their interest as well as their duty to
provide, that those laws should be respected and obeyed. In their national
character and capacity, the United States were responsible to foreign nations
for the conduct of each state, relative to the laws of nations, and the
performance of treaties; and there the inexpediency of referring all such
questions to state courts, and particularly to the courts of delinquent states
became apparent. While all the states were bound to protect each, and the
citizens of each, it was highly proper and reasonable, that they should be in a
capacity, not only to cause justice to be done to  each, and the citizens of each; but also to cause justice to be done by
each, and the citizens of each; and that, not by violence and force, but in a
stable, sedate, and regular course of judicial procedure."</li>

<li><a id="64"></a> Mr. Turgot appears to have been strongly impressed with the difficulty of
maintaining a national government, under such circumstances. In his letter to
Dr. Price, he says: "In the general union of the states, I do not observe
a coalition, a fusion of all the parts to form one homogeneous body. It is only
a jumble of communities too discordant, and which contain a constant tendency
to separation, owing to the diversity in their laws, customs, and opinions, to
the inequality of their present strength, but still more to the inequality of
their advances to greater strength. It is only a copy of the Dutch republic,
with this difference, that the Dutch republic had nothing to fear, as the
American republic has, from the future possible increase of any one of the
provinces. All this edifice has been hitherto supported upon the erroneous
foundation of the most ancient and vulgar policy; upon the prejudice, that
nations and states, as such, may have an interest distinct from the interest,
which individuals have to be free, and defend their property against the
attacks of robber and conquerors," &amp;c. &amp;c. Similar views seem to
have  occupied the mind of a distinguished American gentleman, who published a
pamphlet in 1788, (edit. Worcester,) entitled, " Thoughs upon the
Political Situation of the United States of America," &amp;c. p. 37,
&amp;c.; 1 The Federalist, No. 45, 46, 31.</li>
<li><a id="65"></a> If there be any exception, it is the decision, as to the suability of the
states. But even this deserves not the name of usurpation, for the case falls
clearly within the words of the constitution.</li>

administration both these measures were passed, which were, in the highest
sense, his own measures, was deliberately of opinion, that an amendment of the
constitution was necessary, to authorize the general government to admit
Louisiana into the Union. Yet he ratified the very treaty, which secured this
right; and confirmed the laws, which gave it effect. 4 Jefferson's Corresp. 1,
2, 3. -- A more particular consideration of these subjects will naturally arise
in some future discussions.</li>
