  § 517.
 </b>
 IN surveying the general structure of the constitution of the
United States, we are naturally led to an examination of the fundamental
principles, on which it is organized, for the purpose of carrying into
effect the objects disclosed in the preamble. Every government must include
within its scope, at least if it is to possess suitable stability and
energy, the exercise of the three great powers, upon which all governments
are supposed to rest, viz. the executive, the legislative, and the judicial
powers. The manner and extent, in which these powers are to be exercised,
and the functionaries, in whom they are to be vested, constitute the great
distinctions, which are known in the forms of government. In absolute
governments the whole executive, legislative, and judicial powers are, at
least in their final result, exclusively confined to a single individual;
and such a form of government is denominated a despotism, as the whole
sovereignty of the state is vested in him. If the same powers are
exclusively confided to a few persons, constituting a permanent sovereign
council, the government may be appropriately denominated an absolute or
despotic Aristocracy. If
</p>
<p>
 they are exercised by the people at large in their original sovereign
assemblies, the government is a pure and absolute Democracy. But it is more
common to find these powers divided, and separately exercised by
independent functionaries, the executive power by one department, the
legislative by another, and the judicial by a third; and in these cases the
government is properly deemed a mixed one; a mixed monarchy, if the
executive power is hereditary in a single person; a mixed aristocracy, if
it is hereditary in several chieftains or families; and a mixed democracy
or republic, if it is delegated by election, and is not hereditary. In
mixed monarchies and aristocracies some of the functionaries of the
legislative and judicial powers are, or at least may be, hereditary. But in
a representative republic all power emanates from the people, and is
exercised by their choice, and never extends beyond the lives of the
individuals, to whom it is entrusted. It may be entrusted for any shorter
period; and then it returns to them again, to be again delegated by a new
choice.
</p>
<b>
 § 518.
</b>
In the convention, which framed the constitution of the
United
States, the first resolution adopted by that body was, that "a national
government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme legislative,
judiciary, and executive."
<sup>
 <a href="#1">
  1
 </a>
</sup>
And from this fundamental proposition sprung
the subsequent organization of the whole government of the United States.
It is, then, our duty to examine and consider the grounds, on which this
proposition rests, since it lies at the bottom of all our institutions,
state, as well as national.
<p>
 <b>
  § 519.
 </b>
 In the establishment of a free government, the division
of the
three great powers of government,
</p>
<p>
 the executive, the legislative, and the judicial, among different
functionaries, has been a favorite policy with patriots and statesmen. It
has by many been deemed a maxim of vital importance, that these powers
should for ever be kept separate and distinct. And accordingly we find it
laid down with emphatic care in the bill of rights of several of the state
constitutions. In the constitution of Massachusetts, for example, it is
declared, that "in the government of this commonwealth, the legislative
department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or
either of them; the executive shall never exercise the legislative and
judicial powers, or either of them; the judicial shall never exercise the
legislative and judicial powers, or either of them; to the end it may be a
government of laws and not of men"

 Other declarations of a similar
character are to be found in other state constitutions.

 <b>
  § 520.
 </b>
 Montesquieu seems to have been the first, who, with a truly
philosophical eye, surveyed the political truth involved in this maxim, in
its full extent, and gave to it a paramount importance and value. As it is
tacitly assumed, as a fundamental basis in the constitution of the United
States, in the distribution of its powers, it may be worth inquiry, what is
the true nature, object,
</p>
<p>
 and extent of the maxim, and of the reasoning, by which it is supported.
The remarks of Montesquieu on this subject will be found in a professed
commentary upon the constitution of England.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">

 " When," says he, " the
legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the
same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty, because apprehensions
may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to
execute them in a tyrannical manner. Again; there is no liberty, if the
judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were
it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would
be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be the legislator.
Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence
and oppression. There would be an end of every thing, were the same man, or
the same body, whether of the nobles, or of the people, to exercise these
three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing the public
resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals."
 <sup>
  <a href="#5">
   5
  </a>
 </sup>
 <b>
  § 521.
 </b>
 The same reasoning is adopted by Mr. Justice
Blackstone, in his
Commentaries.
 <sup>
  <a href="#6">
   6
  </a>
 </sup>
 "In all tyrannical governments," says he, "the supreme
magistracy, or the right both of making and of enforcing laws, is vested in
the same man, or one and the same body of men; and wherever these two
powers are united together,
</p>
<p>
 there can be no public liberty. The magistrate may enact tyrannical laws,
and execute them in a tyrannical manner, since he is possessed, in quality
of dispenser of justice, with all the power, which he, as legislator,
thinks proper to give himself. But where the legislative and executive
authority are in distinct hands, the former will take care not to entrust
the latter with so large a power, as may tend to the subversion of its own
independence, and therewith of the liberty of the subject." Again; "In this
distinct and separate existence of the judicial power in a peculiar body of
men, nominated, indeed, by, but not removable at, the pleasure of the
crown, consists one main preservative of the public liberty; which cannot
long subsist in any state, unless the administration of commonjustice be
in some degree separated from the legislative, and also the executive
power. Were it joined with the legislative, the life, liberty, and property
of the subject would be in the hands of arbitrary judges, whose decisions
would then be regulated only by their opinions, and not by any fundamental
principles of law; which, though legislators may depart from, yet judges
are bound to observe. Were it joined with the executive, this union might
soon be an overbalance for the legislative."

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 522.
 </b>
 And the Federalist has, with equal point and brevity, remarked,
that " the accumulation of all powers legislative, executive, and
judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether
hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may be justly pronounced the very
definition of tyranny."
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 523.
 </b>
 The general reasoning, by which the maxim is supported,
independently of the just weight of the authority in its support, seems
entirely satisfactory. What is of far more value than any mere reasoning,
experience has demonstrated it to be founded in a just view of the nature
of government, and the safety and liberty of the people. And it is no small
commendation of the constitution of the United States, that instead of
adopting a new theory, it has placed this practical truth, as the basis of
its organization. It has placed the legislative, executive, and judicial
powers in different hands. It has, as we shall presently see, made their
term of office and their organization different; and, for objects of
permanent and paramount importance, has given to the judicial department a
tenure of office during good be
</p>
<p>
 haviour; while it has limited each of the others to a term of years.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 524.
 </b>
 But when we speak of a separation of the three great
departments of
government, and maintain, that that separation is indispensable to public
liberty, we are to understand this maxim in a limited sense. It is not
meant to affirm, that they must be kept wholly and entirely separate and
distinct, and have no common link of connexion or dependence, the one upon
the other, in the slightest degree. The true meaning is, that the whole
power of one of these departments should not be exercised by the same
hands, which possess the whole power of either of the other departments;
and that such exercise of the whole would subvert the principles of a free
constitution. This has been shown with great clearness and accuracy by the
authors of the Federalist.
 <sup>
  <a href="#9">

  </a>
 </sup>
 It was obviously the view taken of the
subject by Montesquieu and Blackstone in their Commentaries; for they were
each speaking with approbation of a constitution of government, which
embraced this division of powers in a general view; but which, at the same
time, established an occasional mixture of each with the others, and a
mutual dependency of each upon the others. The slightest examination of the
British constitution will at once convince us, that the legislative,
executive, and judiciary departments are by no means totally distinct, and
separate from each other. The executive magistrate forms an integral part
of the legislative department; for parliament consists of the king, lords,
and commons; and no law can be passed except by the assent of the king.
Indeed, he possesses certain prerogatives, such as, for instance, that of
making foreign treaties, by which he can, to a limited extent,
</p>
<p>
 impart to them a legislative force and operation. He also possesses the
sole appointing power to the judicial department, though the judges, when
once appointed, are not subject to his will, or power of removal. The house
of lords also constitutes, not only a vital and independent branch of the
legislature, but is also a great constitutional council of the executive
magistrate, and is, in the last resort, the highest appellate judicial
tribunal. Again; the other branch of the legislature, the commons, possess,
in some sort, a portion of the executive and judicial power, in exercising
the power of accusation by impeachment; and in this case, as also in the
trial of peers, the house of lords sits as a grand court of trials for
public offences. The powers of the judiciary department are, indeed, more
narrowly confined to their own proper sphere. Yet still the judges
occasionally assist in the deliberations of the house of lords by giving
their opinions upon matters of law referred to them for advice; and thus
they may, in some sort, be deemed assessors to the lords in their
legislative, as well as judicial capacity.

 <b>
  § 525.
 </b>
 Mr. Justice Blackstone has illustrated the advantages of an
occasional mixture of the legislative and executive functions in the
English constitution in a striking manner. "It is highly necessary," says
he, " for preserving the balance of the constitution, that the executive
power should be a branch, though not the whole of 'the legislative. The
total union of them, we have seen, would be productive of tyranny. The
total disjunction of them, for the present, would, in the end, produce the
same effects by causing that union, against which it seems to provide. The
legislative would soon
</p>
<p>
 become tyrannical by making continual encroachments, and gradually assuming
to itself the rights of the executive power, &amp;c. To hinder, therefore, any
such encroachments, the king is, himself a part of the parliament; and, as
this is the reason of his being so, very properly, therefore, the share of
legislation, which the constitution has placed in the crown, consists in
the power of rejecting, rather than resolving; this being sufficient to
answer the end proposed. For we may apply to the royal negative, in this
instance, what Cicero observes of the negative of the Roman tribunes, that
the crown has not any power of doing wrong; but merely of preventing wrong
from being done. The crown cannot begin of itself any alterations in the
present established law; but it may approve, or disapprove of the
alterations suggested, and consented to by the two houses."

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 526.
 </b>
 Notwithstanding the memorable terms, in which this
maxim of a
division of powers is incorporated into the bill of rights of many of our
state constitutions, the same mixture will be found provided for, and
indeed required in the same solemn instruments of government. Thus, the
governor of Massachusetts exercises a part of the legislative power,
possessing a qualified negative upon all laws. The house of representatives
is a grand inquest for accusation; and the senate is a high court for the
trial of impeachments. The governor, with the advice of the executive
council, possesses the power of appointment in general; but the appointment
of certain officers still belongs to the senate and house of
representatives. On the other hand, although the judicial department is
distinct from the
</p>
<p>
 executive and legislative in many respects, either branch may require the
advice of the judges, upon solemn questions of law referred to them. The
same general division, with the same occasional mixture, may be found in
the constitutions of other states. And in some of them the deviations from
the strict theory are quite remarkable. Thus, until the late revision, the
constitution of New-York constituted the governor, the chancellor, and the
judges of the Supreme Court, or any two of them with the governor, a
council of revision, which possessed a qualified negative upon all laws
passed by the senate and house of representatives. And, now, the chancellor
and the judges of the Supreme Court of that state constitute, with the
senate, a court of impeachment, and for the correction of errors. In
New-Jersey the governor is appointed by the legislature, and is the
chancellor and ordinary, or surrogate, a member of the Supreme Court of
Appeals, and president, with a casting vote, of one of the branches of the
legislature. In Virginia the great mass of the appointing power is vested
in the legislature. Indeed, there is not a single constitution of any state
in the Union, which does not practically embrace some acknowledgment of the
maxim, and at the same time some admixture of powers constituting an
exception to it.

  § 627.
 </b>
 It would not, perhaps, be thought important to have
dwelt on this
subject, if originally it had not been made a special objection to the
constitution of the United States, that though it professed to be founded
upon a division of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments,
yet it was really chargeable with a departure from the doctrine by
accumulating in some
</p>
<p>
 instances the different powers in the same hands, and by a mixture of them
in others; so, that it, in effect, subverted the maxim, and could not but
be dangerous to the public liberty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">
   13
  </a>
 </sup>
 The fact must be admitted, that such
an occasional accumulation and mixture exists; but the conclusion, that the
system is therefore dangerous to the public liberty, is wholly
inadmissible. If the objection were well founded, it would apply with
equal, and in some cases with far greater force to most of our state
constitutions; and thus the people would be proved their own worst enemies,
by embodying in their own constitutions the means of overthrowing their
liberties.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 528.
 </b>
 The authors of the Federalist thought this subject a
matter of vast
importance, and accordingly bestowed upon it a most elaborate commentary.
At the present time the objection may not be felt, as possessing much
practical force, since experience has demonstrated the fallacy of the
suggestions, on which it was founded. But, as the objection may be revived;
and as a perfect separation is occasionally found supported by the opinions
of ingenious minds, dazzled by theory, and extravagantly attached to the
notion of simplicity in government, it may not be without use to recur to
some of the reasoning, by which those illustrious statesmen, who formed the
constitution, while they admitted the general truth of the maxim,
endeavoured to prove, that a rigid adherence to it in all cases would be
subversive of the efficiency of the government, and result in the
destruction of the public liberties. The proposition, which they undertook
to maintain, was this, that "unless these departments be so far connected
and blended, as to give to each a constitutional control over
</p>
<p>
 the others, the degree of separation, which the maxim requires, as
essential to a free government, can never in practice be duly maintained."
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 529.
 </b>
 It is proper to premise, that it is agreed on all
sides, that the
powers belonging to one department ought not to be directly and completely
administered by either of the other departments; and, as a corollary, that,
in reference to each other, neither of them ought to possess, directly or
indirectly, an overruling influence in the administration of their
respective powers.
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
 Power, however, is of an encroaching nature, and it
ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.
Having separated the three great departments by a broad line from each
other, the difficult task remains to provide some practical means for the
security of each against the meditated or occasional invasions of the
others. Is it sufficient to declare on parchment in the constitution, that
each shall remain, and neither shall usurp the functions of the other? No
one, well read in history in general, or even in our own history during the
period of the existence of our state constitutions, will place much
reliance on such declarations. In the first place, men may and will differ,
as to the nature and extent of the prohibition. Their wishes and their
interests, the prevalence of faction, an apparent necessity, or a
predominant popularity, will give a strong bias to their judgments, and
easily satisfy them with reasoning, which has but a plausible colouring.
And it has been accordingly round, that the theory has bent under the
occasional pressure, as well as under the occasional elasticity of public
opinion, and as well in the states, as in the general government under the
confed-
</p>
<p>
 eration. Usurpations of power have been notoriously assumed by particular
departments in each; and it has often happened, that these very usurpations
have received popular favour and indulgence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#16">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 530.
 </b>
 In the next place, in order to preserve in full vigour the
constitutional barrier between each department, when they are entirely
separated, it is obviously indispensable, that each should possess equally,
and in the same degree, the means of self-protection. Now, in point of
theory, this would be almost impracticable, if not impossible; and in point
of fact, it is well known, that the means of self-protection in the
different departments are immeasurably disproportionate. The judiciary is
incomparably the weakest of either; and must for ever, in a considerable
measure, be subjected to the legislative power. And the latter has, and
must have, a controlling influence over the executive power, since it holds
at its own command all the resources, by which a chief magistrate could
make himself formidable. It possesses the power over the purse of the
nation, and the property of the people. It can grant, or withhold supplies;
it can levy, or withdraw taxes; it can unnerve the power of the sword by
striking down the arm, which wields it.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 531.
 </b>
 De Lolme has said, with great emphasis, "It is, without
doubt,
absolutely necessary for securing the constitution of a state, to restrain
the executive power; but it is still more necessary to restrain the
legislative. What the former can duly do by successive steps, (I mean
subvert the laws,) and through a longer, or a shorter train of enterprises,
the latter does in a moment. As its bare will can give being to the laws,
so its bare
</p>
<p>
 will can also annihilate them; and if I may be permitted the expression,
the legislative power can change the constitution, as God created the
light. In order, therefore, to insure stability to the constitution of a
state, it is indispensably necessary to restrain the legislative authority.
But, here, we must observe a difference between the legislative and
executive powers. The latter may be confined, and even is more easily so,
when undivided. The legislative, on the contrary, in order to its being
restrained, should absolutely be divided."
 <sup>

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 532.
 </b>
 The truth is, that the legislative power is the great
and overruling
power in every free government. It has been remarked with equal force and
sagacity, that the legislative power is every where extending the sphere of
its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex. The founders
of our republics, wise as they were, under the influence and the dread of
the royal prerogative, which was pressing upon them, never for a moment
seem to have turned their eyes from the immediate danger to liberty from
that source, combined, as it was, with an hereditary authority, and an
hereditary peerage to support it. They seem never to have recollected the
danger from legislative usurpation, which, by ultimately assembling all
power in the same hands, must lead to the same tyranny, as is threatened by
executive usurpations. The representatives of the people will watch with
jealousy every encroachment of the executive magistrate, for it trenches
upon their own authority. But, who shall watch the encroachment of these
representatives themselves?  Will they be as jealous of the exercise of
power by themselves, as by
</p>
<p>
 others? In a representative republic, where the executive magistracy is
carefully limited, both in the extent and duration of its power; and where
the legislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired, by a
supposed influence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its own
strength; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions, which
actuate the multitude; yet not go numerous, as to be incapable of pursuing
the objects of its passions by means, which reason prescribes; it is easy
to see, that the tendency to the usurpation of power is, if not constant,
at least probable; and that it is against the enterprising ambition of this
department, that the people may well indulge all their jealousy, and
exhaust all their precautions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 533.
 </b>
 There are many reasons, which may be assigned for the
engrossing
influence of the legislative department. In the first place, its
constitutional powers are more extensive, and less capable of being brought
within precise limits, than those of either of the other departments. The
bounds of the executive authority are easily marked out, and defined. It
reaches few objects, and those are known; It cannot transcend them, without
being brought in contact with the other departments. Laws may check and
restrain, and bound its exercise. The same remarks apply with still greater
force to the judiciary; The jurisdiction is, or may be, bounded to a few
objects or persons; or, however general and unlimited, its operations are
necessarily confined to the mere administration of private and public
justice. It cannot punish without law. It cannot create controversies to
act upon. It can decide only
</p>
<p>
 upon rights and cases, as they are brought by others before it. It can do
nothing for itself. It must do every thing, for others. It must obey the
laws; and if it corruptly administers them, it is subjected to the power of
impeachment. On the other hand, the legislative power, except in the few
cases of constitutional prohibition, is unlimited. It is for ever varying
its means and its ends. It governs the institutions, and laws, and public
policy of the country. It regulates all its vast interests. It disposes of
all its property. Look but at the exercise of two or three branches of its
ordinary powers. It levies all taxes; it directs and appropriates all
supplies; it gives the rules for the descent, distribution, and devises of
all property held by individuals. It controls the sources and the resources
of wealth. It changes at its will the whole fabric of the laws. It moulds
at its pleasure almost all the institutions, which give strength, and
comfort, and dignity to society.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 534.
 </b>
 In the next place, it is the direct, visible
representative of the
will of the people in all the changes of times and circumstances. It has
the pride, as well as the power of numbers.
 <sup>
  <a href="#19">
   19
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is easily moved and
steadily moved by the strong impulses of popular reeling, and popular
odium. It obeys, without reluctance, the wishes and the will of the
majority for the time being. The path to public favour lies open by such
obedience; and it finds not only support, but impunity, in whatever
measures the majority advises, even though they transcend the
constitutional limits. It has no motive, therefore, to be jealous, or
scrupulous in its own use of power; and it finds its ambition stimulated,
</p>
<p>
 and its arm strengthened by the countenance, and the courage of numbers.
These views are not alone those of men, who look with apprehension upon the
fate of republics; but they are also freely admitted by some of the
strongest advocates for popular rights, and the permanency of republican
institutions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">

 Our domestic history furnishes abundant examples to verify
these suggestions.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 535.
 </b>
 If, then, the legislative power possesses a decided
preponderance
of influence over either or both of the others; and if, in its own separate
structure, it furnishes no effectual security for the others, or for its
own abstinence from usurpations, it will not be sufficient to rely upon a
mere constitutional division of the powers to insure our liberties.

 <b>
  § 536.
 </b>
 What remedy, then, can be proposed, adequate for the
exigency? It
has been suggested, that an appeal to the people, at stated times, might
redress any inconveniences of this sort. But, if these be frequent, it will
have a tendency to lessen that respect for, and confidence in the stability
of our constitutions, which is so essential to their salutary influence. If
it be true, that all governments rest on opinion, it is no less true, that
the strength of opinion in each individual, and its practical influence on
his conduct, depend much upon the number, which he supposes to have
entertained the same opinion.
 <sup>

 There is, too, no small danger in
disturbing the public tranquillity by a fre-
</p>
<p>
 quent recurrence to questions respecting the fundamental principles of
government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">
   24
  </a>
 </sup>
 Whoever has been present in any assembly, convened for such
a purpose, must have perceived the great diversities of opinion upon the
most vital questions; and the extreme difficulty in bringing a majority to
concur in the longsighted wisdom of the soundest provisions. Temporary
feelings and excitements, popular prejudices, an ardent love of theory, an
enthusiastic temperament, inexperience, and ignorance, as well as
preconceived opinions, operate wonderfully to blind the judgment, and
seduce the understanding. It will probably be found, in the history of most
conventions of this sort, that the best and soundest parts of the
constitution, those, which give it permanent value, as well as safe and
steady operation, are precisely those, which have enjoyed the least of the
public favour at the moment, or were least estimated by the framers. A
lucky hit, or a strong figure, has not unfrequently overturned the best
reasoned plan. Thus, Dr. Franklin's remark, that a legislature, with two
branches, was a wagon, drawn by a horse before, and a horse behind, in
opposite directions, is understood to have been decisive in inducing
Pennsylvania, in her original constitution, to invest all the legislative
power in a single body.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 In her present constitution, that error has been
fortunately corrected. It is not believed, that the clause in the
constitution of Vermont providing for a septennial council of censors to
inquire into the infractions of her constitution during the last septenary,
and to recommend suitable measures to the legislature, and to call,
</p>
<p>
 if they see fit, a convention to amend the constitution, has been of any
practical advantage in that state in securing it against legislative or
other usurpations, beyond the security possessed by other states, having no
such provision.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 537.
 </b>
 On the other hand, if an appeal to the people, or a
convention, is
to be called only at great distances of time, it will afford no redress for
the most pressing mischiefs. And if the measures, which are supposed to be
infractions of the constitution, enjoy popular favour, or combine extensive
private interests, or hare taken root in the habits of the government, it
is obvious, that the chances of any effectual redress will be essentially
diminished.

 </b>
 But a more conclusive objection is, that the decisions
upon all
such appeals would not answer the purpose of maintaining, or restoring the
constitutional equilibrium of the government. The remarks of the
Federalist, on this subject, are so striking, that they scarcely admit of
abridgment without impairing their force: "We have seen, that the tendency
of republican governments is to aggrandizement of the legislature at the
expense of the other departments. The appeals to the people, therefore,
would usually be made by the executive and judiciary departments. But
whether made by one or the other, would each side enjoy equal advantages on
the trial? Let us view their different situations. The members of the
executive and judiciary departments are few in number, and can be
personally known to a small part
</p>
<p>
 only of the people. The latter, by the mode of their appointment, as well
as by the nature and permanency of it, are too far removed from the people
to share much in their professions. The former are generally objects of
jealousy; and their administration is always liable to be discoloured and
rendered unpopular. The members of the legislative department, on the other
hand, are numerous. They are distributed and dwell among the people at
large.  Their connexions of blood, of friendship, and of acquaintance,
embrace a great proportion of the most influential part of the society. The
nature of their  public trust implies a personal weight with the people,
and that they are more immediately the confidential guardians of their
rights and liberties. With these advantages it can hardly be supposed, that
the adverse party would have an equal chance of a favourable issue. But the
legislative party would not only be able to plead their case most
successfully with the people; they would probably be constituted themselves
the judges. The same influence, which had gained them an election into the
legislature, would gain them a seat in the convention. If this should not
be the case with all, it would probably be the  case with many, and pretty
certainly with those  leading characters, on whom every thing depends in
such bodies. The convention, in short, would be composed chiefly of men,
who had been, or who  actually were, or who expected to be, members of the
department, whose conduct was arraigned. They would consequently be parties
to the very question to be decided by them."

  § 539.

 If, then, occasional or periodical appeals to the people
would not
afford an effectual barrier against the inroads of the legislature upon the
other departments of the government, it is manifest, that resort must be
had to some contrivances in the interior structure of the government
itself, which shall exert a constant check, and preserve the mutual
relations of each with the other. Upon a thorough examination of the
subject, it will be found, that this can be best accomplished, if not
solely accomplished, by an occasional mixture of the powers of each
department with that of the others, while the separate existence, and
constitutional independence of each are fully provided for. Each department
should have a will of its own, and the members of each should have but a
limited agency in the acts and appointments of the members of the others.
Each should have its own independence secured beyond the power of being
taken away by either, or both of the others. But at the same time the
relations of each to the other should be so strong, that there should be a
mutual interest to sustain. and protect each other. There should not only
be constitutional means, but personal motives, to resist encroachments of
one, or either of the others. Thus, ambition would be made to counteract
ambition; the desire of power to check power; and the pressure of interest
to balance an opposing interest.

  § 540.
 </b>
 There seems no adequate method of producing this result
but by a
partial participation of each
</p>
<p>
 in the powers of the other; and by introducing into every operation of the
government in all its branches, a system of checks and balances, on which
the safety of free institutions has ever been found essentially to depend.
Thus, for instance, a guard against rashness and violence in legislation
has often been found, by distributing the power among different branches,
each having a negative check upon the other. A guard against the inroads of
the legislative power upon the executive has been in like manner applied,
by giving the latter a qualified negative upon the former; and a guard
against executive influence and patronage, or unlawful exercise of
authority, by requiring the concurrence of a select council, or a branch of
the legislature in appointments to office, and in the discharge of other
high functions, as well as by placing the command of the revenue in other
hands.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 541.
 </b>
 The usual guard, applied for the security of the judicial
department, has been in the tenure of office of the judges, who commonly
are to hold office during good behaviour. But this is obviously an
inadequate provision, while the legislature is entrusted with a complete
power over the salaries of the judges, and over the jurisdiction of the
courts, so that they can alter, or diminish them at pleasure. Indeed, the
judiciary is naturally, and almost necessarily (as has been already said)
the weakest department.

 It can have no means of influence by patronage.
Its powers can never be wielded for itself. It has no command over the
purse or the sword of the nation. It can neither lay taxes, nor appropriate
money, nor command armies, or appoint to offices. It is never brought into
contact
</p>
<p>
 with the people by the constant appeals and solicitations, and private
intercourse, which belong to all the other departments of government. It is
seen only in controversies, or in trials and punishments. Its rigid justice
and impartiality give it no claims to favour, however they may to respect.
It stands solitary and unsupported, except by that portion of public
opinion, which is interested only in the strict administration of justice.
It can rarely secure the sympathy, or zealous support, either of the
executive, or the legislature. If they are not (as is not unfrequently the
case) jealous of its prerogatives, the constant necessity of scrutinizing
the acts of each, upon the application of any private person, and the
painful duty of pronouncing judgment, that these acts are a departure from
the law or constitution, can hare no tendency to conciliate kindness, or
nourish influence. It would seem, therefore, that some additional guards
would, under such circumstances, be necessary to protect this department
from the absolute dominion of the others. Yet rarely have any such guards
been applied; and every attempt to introduce them has been resisted with a
pertinacity, which demonstrates, how slow popular leaders are to introduce
checks upon their own power; and how slow the people are to believe, that
the judiciary is the real bulwark of their liberties. In some of the states
the judicial department is partially combined with some branches of the
executive and legislative departments; and it is believed, that in those
cases, it has been found no unimportant auxiliary in preserving a wholesome
vigour in the laws, as well as a wholesome administration of public
justice.

  § 542.
 </b>
 How far the constitution of the United States, in the actual
separation of these departments, and the
</p>
<p>
 occasional mixtures of some of the powers of each, has accomplished the
objects of the great maxim, which we have been considering, will appear
more fully, when a survey is taken of the particular powers confided to
each department. But the true and only test must, after all, be experience,
which corrects at once the errors of theory, and fortifies and illustrates
the eternal judgments of nature.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 543.
 </b>
 It is not a little singular, however, (as has been
already stated,)
that one of the principal objections urged against the constitution at the
time of its adoption was this occasional mixture of powers,
 <sup>
  <a href="#31">
   31
  </a>
 </sup>
 upon which,
if the preceding reasoning (drawn, as must be seen, from the ablest
commentators) be well founded, it must depend for life and practical
influence. It was said, that the several departments of power were
distributed, and blended in such a manner, as at once to destroy all
symmetry and beauty of form; and to expose some of the essential parts of
the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight
of the other parts. The objection, as it presents itself in details, will
be more accurately examined hereafter. But it may here be said, that the
experience of more than forty years has demonstrated the entire safety of
this distribution, at least in the quarter, where the objection was
supposed to apply with most force. If any department of the government has
an undue influence, or absorbing power, it certainly has not been either
the executive or judiciary.

never calculate; the multitude are never checked by remorse, and will even
ascribe to themselves the highest honour, when they deserve only disgrace."

on the same subject, are full of his usual practical sense. "The first
maxim," says he, "of a free state is, that the laws be made by one set of
men, and administered by another; in other words, that the legislative and
judicial characters be kept separate. When these offices are united in the
same person or assembly, particular laws are made for particular cases,
springing oftentimes from partial motives, and directed to private ends.
Whilst they are kept separate, general laws are made by one body of men,
without foreseeing whom they may affect; and, when made, they must be
applied by the other, let them affect whom they will. "For the sake of illustration let it be supposed, in this country, either  that, parliaments being laid aside, the courts of Westminster Hall made
their own laws; or, that the two hoses of parliament, with the king at
their head, tried and decided causes at their bar. It is evident, in the
first place, that the decisions of such a judicature would be so many laws;
and, in the second place, that, when the parties and the interests to be
affected by the laws were known, the inclinations of the law-makers would
inevitably attach on one side or the other; and that where there were
neither any fixed rules to regulate their determinations, nor any superior
power to control their proceedings, these inclinations would interfere with
the integrity of public justice. The consequence of which must be, that the
subjects of such a constitution would live either without any constant
laws, that is, without any known pre-established rules of adjudication
whatever; or under laws made for particular persons, and partaking of the
contradictions and iniquity of the motives, to which they owed their
origin.   These dangers, by the division of the legislative and judicial
functions, are in this country effectually provided against. Parliament
knows not the individuals, upon whom its acts will operate; it has no cases
or parties before it; no private designs to serve: consequently, its
resolutions will be suggested by the consideration of universal effects and
tendencies, which always produce impartial, and commonly advantageous
regulations. When laws are made, courts or justice, whatever be the
disposition of the judges, must abide by them; for the legislative being
necessarily the supreme power of the state, the judicial and every other
power is accountable to that: and it cannot be doubted, that the persons,
who possess the sovereign authority of government, will be tenacious of the
laws, which they themselves prescribe, and sufficiently jealous of the
assumption of dispensing and legislative power by any others." Paley's

Letter, 4 Elliot's Deb. 133; Woodeson's Elem. of Jurisp. 53, 56. -- Mr.
Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia,*  has expressed the same truth with
peculiar fervour and force. Speaking of the constitution of government of
his own state, he Says, " all the powers of government, legislative
executive, and judiciary, result to the legislative body. The concentrating
these in the same hands is precisely the definition of a despotic * Jefferson's Notes, p. 195.  government. It will be no alleviation, that these powers will be exercised
by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one. One hundred and
seventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive as one. Let those, who
doubt it, turn their eyes on the republic of Venice. An elective despotism
is not the government we fought for; but one, which should not only be
founded on free principles, but in which the powers of, government should
be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no
one could transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked
and restrained by the others " Yet Virginia lived voluntarily under this
constitution more than fifty years;*  and, not withstanding this solemn
warning, by her own favourite statesman, in the recent revision of her old
constitution and the formation of a new one, she has not in this respect
changed the powers of the government. The legislature still remains with
all its great powers. No person, however, has examined this whole subject more profoundly, and
with more illustrations from history and political philosophy, than Mr.
John Adams, in his celebrated Defence of the American Constitutions. It
deserves a thorough perusal by every statesman. Milton was an open advocate for concentrating all powers, legislative and
executive, in one body; and his opinions, as well as those of some other
men of a philosophical cast, are sufficiently wild and extravagant to put
us upon our guard against too much reliance on mere authority.# * See 2 Pitkin's Hist. 293, 299, 300. # See 1 Adams's Def. of Amer. Const. 365 to 371.</li>
