 § 544. THE first article of the constitution contains the structure,
organization, and powers, of the legislature of the Union. Each section of
that article, and indeed, of every other article, will require a careful
analysis, and distinct examination. It is proposed, therefore, to bring
each separately under review, in the present commentaries, and to unfold
the reasons, on which each is founded, the objections, which have been
urged against it, and the interpretation, so far as it can satisfactorily
be ascertained, of the terms, in which each is expressed.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 545.
 </b>
 The first section, of the first article is in the
following words:
"All legislative powers herein granted "shall be vested in a congress of
the United States, which "shall consist of a senate and house of
representatives."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 546.
 </b>
 This section involves, as a fundamental rule, the
exercise of the
legislative power by two distinct and independent branches. Under the
confederation, the whole legislative power of the Union was vested in a
single branch. Limited as was that power, the concentration of it in a
single body was deemed a prominent defect of the confederation. But if a
single assembly could properly be deemeda fit receptacle of the slender
and fettered authorities, confided to the federal government by that
instrument, it could scarcely be consistent with the principles of a good
government to entrust it with the more enlarged and vigorous powers
delegated in the constitution.

 <b>
  § 547.
 </b>
 The utility of a subdivision of the legislative power into
different branches, having a negative upon each other, is, perhaps, at the
present time admitted by most persons of sound reflection.
 <sup>
  <a href="#2">

 </sup>
 But it has
not always found general approbation; and is, even now, sometimes disputed
by men of speculative ingenuity, and recluse habits. It has been justly
observed, that there is scarcely in the whole science of politics a more
important maxim, and one, which bears with greater influence upon the
practical operations of government. It has been already stated, that
Pennsylvania, in her first constitution, adopted the scheme of a single
body, as the depositary of the legislative power, under the influence, as
is understood, of a mind of a very high philosophical character.
 <sup>
  <a href="#3">

 Georgia, also, is said in her first constitution, (since changed,) to have
confided the whole legislative power to a single body.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">

 Vermont adopted
the same course, giving, however, to the executive council a power of
revision; and of proposing amendments, to which she yet adheres.
 <sup>
  <a href="#5">

 We are
also told by a distinguished statesman of great accuracy and learning, that
at the first formation of our state constitutions, it was made a question
of transcendant importance, and divided the opinions of our most eminent
men. Legislation, being merely the expression of the will of the community,
was thought to be an operation so simple in its nature, that inexperienced
reason could not readily perceive the necessity of committing it to
</p>
<p>
 two bodies of men, each having a decisive check upon the action of the
other. All the arguments derived from the analogy between the movements of
political bodies, and the operations of physical nature; all the impulses
of political parsimony; all the prejudices against a second co-ordinate
legislative assembly stimulated by the exemplification of it in the British
parliament, were against a division of the legislative power.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 548.
 </b>
 It is also certain, that the notion, that the
legislative power
ought to be confided to a single body, has been, at various times, adopted
by men eminent for their talents and virtues. Milton, Turgot, Franklin, are
but a few among, those, who have professedly entertained, and  discussed
the question.
 <sup>
  <a href="#7">

 Sir James Mackintosh, in a work of a controversial
character, written with the zeal and eloquence of youth, advocated the
doctrine of a single legislative body.

 Perhaps his maturer life may have
changed this early opinion. At all events, he can, in our day, count few
followers. Against his opinion, thus uttered, there is the sad example of
France itself, whose first constitution, in 1791, was formed on this basis,
and whose proceedings the genius of this great man was employed to
vindicate. She stands a monument of the folly and mischiefs of the scheme;
and by her subsequent adoption of a division of the legislative power, she
has secured to herself (as it is hoped) the permanent blessings of
liberty.

 Against all visionary reasoning of this sort, Mr. Chancellor
Kent
</p>
<p>
 has, in a few pages of pregnant sense and brevity, condensed a decisive
argument.
 <sup>
  <a href="#10">

 There is danger, however, that it may hereafter be revived;
and indeed it is occasionally hinted by gifted minds, as a problem yet
worthy of a fuller trial.

<p>
 <b>
  § 549.
 </b>
 It may not, therefore, be uninstructive to review some
of the
principal arguments, by which this division is vindicated. The first and
most important ground is, that it forms a great check upon undue, hasty,
and oppressive legislation. Public bodies, like private persons, are
occasionally under the dominion of strong passions and excitements;
impatient, irritable, and impetuous. The habit of acting together produces
a strong tendency to what, for want of a better word, may be called the
corporation spirit, or what is so happily expressed in a foreign phrase,
I'esprit du corps. Certain popular leaders often acquire an extraordinary
ascendency over the body, by their talents, their eloquence, their
intrigues, or their cunning. Measures are often introduced in a hurry, and
debated with little care, and examined with less caution. The very
restlessness of many minds produces an utter impossibility of debating with
much deliberation, when a measure has a plausible aspect, and enjoys a
momentary favour. Nor is it infrequent, especially in cases of this sort,
to overlook well-founded objections to a measure, not only because the
advocates of it have little desire to bring them in review, but because the
opponents are often seduced into a credulous silence. A legislative body is
not ordinarily apt to mistrust its own powers, and far
</p>
<p>
 less the temperate exercise of those powers. As it prescribes its own rules
for its own deliberations, it easily relaxes them, whenever any pressure is
made for an immediate decision. If it feels no check 'out its own will, it
rarely has the firmness to insist upon holding a question long enough under
its own view, to see and mark it in all its bearings and relations on
society.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 550.
 </b>
 But it is not merely inconsiderate and rash
legislation, which is
to be guarded against, in the ordinary course of things. There is a strong,
propensity in public bodies to accumulate power in their own hands, to
widen the extent of their own influence, and to absorb within their own
circle the means, and the motives of patronage. If the whole legislative
power is vested in a single body, there can be, practically, no restraint
upon the fullest exercise of that power; and of any usurpation, which it
may seek to excuse or justify, either from necessity or a superior regard
to the public good. It has been often said, that necessity is the plea of
tyrants; but it is equally true, that it is the plea of all public bodies
invested with power, where no check exists upon its exercise.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">
   13
  </a>
 </sup>
 Mr. Hume
has remarked with
</p>
<p>
 great sagacity, that men are generally more honest in their private, than
in their public capacity; and will go greater lengths to serve a party,
than when their own private interest is alone concerned. Honour is a great
check upon mankind. But where a considerable body of men act together, this
check is in a great measure removed, since a man is sure to be approved of
by his own party, for what promotes the common interest; and he soon learns
to despise the clamours of adversaries.
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 This is by no means an opinion
peculiar to Mr. Hume. It will be found lying at the foundation of the
political reasonings of many of the greatest men in all ages, as the result
of a close survey of the passions, and infirmaties, of the history, and
experience of mankind.
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
 With a, view, therefore, to preserve the rights
and liberties of the people against unjust encroachments, and to secure the
equal benefits of a free constitution, it is of vital importance to
interpose some check against the undue exercise of the legislative power,
which in every government is the predominating, and almost irresistible
power?

  <a href="#16">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 551.
 </b>
 This subject is put in a very strong light by an
eminent writer,
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">
   17
  </a>
 </sup>
 whose mode of reasoning can be
</p>
<p>
 best conveyed in his own words. "If," says he, "we should extend our
candour so far, as to own, that the majority of mankind are generally under
the dominion of benevolence and good intentions; yet it must be confessed,
that a vast majority frequently transgress; and what is more decidedly in
point, not only a majority, but almost all, confine their benevolence to
their families, relations, personal friends, parish, village, city, county,
province; and that very few indeed extend it impartially to the whole
community. Now, grant but this truth, and the question is decided. If a
majority are capable of preferring their own private interests, or that of
their families, counties, and party, to that of the nation collectively,
some provision must be made in the constitution in favour of justice, to
compel all to respect the common right, the public good, the universal law
in preference to all private and partial considerations."
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">
   18
  </a>
 </sup>
 Again: "Of all
possible forms of government, a sovereignty in one assembly, successively
chosen by the people, is, perhaps, the best calculated to facilitate the
gratification of self-love, and the pursuit of the private interests of a
few individuals. A few eminent, conspicuous characters will be continued in
their seats in the sovereign assembly from one election to another,
whatever changes are made in the seats around them. By superior art,
address, and opulence, by more splendid birth, reputations, and connexions,
they will be able to intrigue with the people, and their leaders out of
doors, until they worm out most of their opposers, and introduce their
friends. To this end they will bestow all offices, contracts, privileges in
commerce, and other emoluments on the latter, and their connexions, and
</p>
<p>
 throw every vexation and disappointment in the way of the former, until
they establish such a system of hopes and fears throughout the whole state,
as shall enable them to carry a majority in every fresh election of the
house. The judges will be appointed by them and their party, and of
consequence will be obsequious enough to their inclinations. The whole
judicial authority, as well as the executive, will be employed, perverted,
and prostituted, to the purposes of electioneering. No justice will be
attainable; nor will innocence or virtue be safe in the judicial courts,
but for the friends of the prevailing leaders. Legal prosecutions will be
instituted, and carried on against opposers to their vexation and ruin. And
as they have the public purse at command, as well as the executive and
judicial power, the public money will be expended in the same way. No
favours will be attainable, but by those, who will court the ruling
demagogues of the house, by voting for their friends, and instruments; and
pensions, and pecuniary rewards and gratifications, as well as honours, and
offices of every kind, voted to friends and partisans, &amp;c. &amp;c. The press,
that great barrier and bulwark of the rights of mankind, when it is
protected by law, can no longer be free. If the authors, writers, and
printers, will not accept of the hire, that will be offered them, they must
submit to the ruin, that will be denounced against them. The presses, with
much secrecy and concealment, will be made the vehicles of calumny against
the minority, and of panegyric, and empirical applauses of the leaders of
the majority, and no remedy can possibly be obtained. In one word, the
whole system of affairs, and every conceivable motive of hope or fear, will
be employed to promote the private interests of a few, and their obsequious
majority; and
</p>
<p>
 there is no remedy but in arms. Accordingly we find in all the Italian
republics, the minority always were driven to arms in despair.

  § 552.
 </b>
 Another learned writer has ventured on the bold
declaration, that
"a single legislature is calculated to unite in it all the pernicious
qualities of the different extremes of bad government. It produces general
weakness, inactivity, and confusion; and these are intermixed with sudden
and violent fits of despotism, injustice and cruelty."
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">
   20
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 553.
 </b>
 Without conceding, that this language exhibits an
unexaggerated
picture of the results of the legislative power being vested in a single
assembly, there is enough in it to satisfy the minds of considerate men,
that there is great danger in such an exclusive deposit of it.
 <sup>
  <a href="#21">
   21
  </a>
 </sup>
 Some
check ought to be provided, to maintain the real balance intended by the
constitution; and this check will be most effectually obtained by a
co-ordinate branch of equal authority, and different organization, which
shall have the same legislative power, and possess an independent negative
upon the doings of the other branch. The value of the check will, indeed,
in a great measure depend upon this difference of organization. If the term
of office, the qualifications, the mode of election, the persons and
interests represented by each branch, are exactly the same, the check will
be less powerful, and the guard less perfect, than if some, or all of these
ingredients differ, so as to bring into play all the various interests and
influences, which belong to a free, honest, and enlightened society.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 554.
 </b>
 The value, then, of a distribution of the legislative
power,
between two branches, each possessing a negative upon the other, may be
summed up under the following, heads. First: It operates directly as a
security against hasty, rash, and dangerous legislation; and allows errors
and mistakes to be corrected, before they have produced any public
mischiefs. It interposes delay between the introduction, and final adoption
of a measure; and thus furnishes time for reflection; and for the
successive deliberations of different bodies, actuated by different
motives, and organized upon different principles.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 555.
 </b>
 In the next place, it operates indirectly as a preventive to
attempts to carry private, personal, or party objects, not connected with
the common good. The very circumstance, that there exists another body
clothed with equal power, and jealous or its own rights, and independent of
the influence of the leaders, who favour a particular measure, by whom it
must be scanned, and to whom it must be recommended upon its own merits,
will have a silent tendency to discourage the efforts to carry it by
surprise, or by intrigue, or by corrupt party combinations. It is far less
easy to deceive, or corrupt, or persuade two bodies into a course,
subversive of the general good, than it is one; especially if the elements,
of which they are composed, are essentially different.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 556.
 </b>
 In the next place, as legislation necessarily acts, or
may act,
upon the whole community, and involves interests of vast difficulty and
complexity, and requires nice adjustments, and comprehensive enactments, it
is of the greatest consequence to secure an independent review of it by
different minds, acting under different, and sometimes opposite opinions
and
</p>
<p>
 feelings; so, that it may be as perfect, as human wisdom can devise. An
appellate jurisdiction, therefore, that acts, and is acted upon
alternatively, in the exercise of an independent revisory authority, must
have the means, and can scarely fail to possess, the will, to give it a
full and satisfactory review. Every one knows, notwithstanding all the
guards interposed to secure due deliberation, how imperfect all human
legislation is; how much it embraces of doubtful principle, and of still
more doubtful utility; how various, and yet how defective, are its
provisions to protect rights, and to redress wrongs. Whatever, therefore,
naturally and necessarily awakens doubt, solicits caution, attracts
inquiry, or stimulates vigilance and industry, is of value to aid us
against precipitancy in framing, or altering laws, as well as against
yielding to the suggestions of indolence, the selfish projects of ambition,
or the cunning devices of corrupt and hollow demagogues.
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
 For this
purpose, no better expedient has, as yet, been found, than the creation of
an independent branch of censors to revise the legislative enactments of
others, and to alter, amend, or reject them at its pleasure, which, in
return, its own are to pass through a like ordeal.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 557.
 </b>
 In the nest place, there can scarcely be any other adequate
security against encroachments upon the constitutional rights and liberties
of the people. Algernon Sidney has said with great force, that the
legislative power is always arbitrary, and not to be trusted in the hands
of any, who are not bound to obey the
</p>
<p>
 laws they make.
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
 But it is not less true, that it has a constant tendency
to overleap its proper boundaries, from passion, from ambition, from
inadvertence, from the prevalence of faction, or from the overwhelming
influence of private interests.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">
   24
  </a>
 </sup>
 Under such circumstances, the only
effectual barrier against oppression, accidental or intentional, is to
separate its operations, to balance interest against interest, ambition
against ambition, the combinations and spirit of dominion of one body
against the like combinations and spirit of another. And it is obvious,
that the more various the elements, which enter into the actual composition
of each body, the greater the security will be.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 Mr. Justice Wilson has
truly remarked, that, "when a single legislature is determined to depart
from the principles of the constitution, and its uncontrollable power may
prompt the determination, there is no constitutional authority to check its
progress. It may proceed by long and hasty strides in violating the
constitution, till nothing but a revolution can check its career. Far
different will the case be, when the legislature consists of two branches.
If one of them should depart, or attempt to depart, from the principles of
the constitution, it will be drawn back by the other. The very apprehension
of the event will prevent the departure, or the attempt.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 558.
 </b>
 Such is an outline of the general reasoning, by which the
system of
a separation of the legislative power into two branches has been maintained
experience has shown, that if in all cases it has not been found a complete
check to inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation; yet, that it has,
upon many occasions, been round sufficient for the purpose. There is not
probably at this moment a single state in the Union, which would consent to
unite the two branches into one assembly; though there have not been
wanting at all times minds of a high order, which have been led by
enthusiasm, or a love of simplicity, or a devotion to theory, to vindicate
such a union with arguments, striking and plausible, if not convincing.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 559.
 </b>
 In the convention, which formed the constitution, upon the
resolution moved, "that the national legislature ought to consist of two
branches," all the states present, except. Pennsylvania, voted in the
affirmative.
 <sup>
  <a href="#27">
   27
  </a>
 </sup>
 At a subsequent period, however, seven only, of eleven
states present, voted in the affirmative; three in the negative, and one
was divided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#28">
   28
  </a>
 </sup>
 But, although in the convention this diversity of opinion
appears,
 <sup>
  <a href="#29">
   29
  </a>
 </sup>
 it seems probable, that ultimately, when a national government
was decided on, which should exert great controlling authority over the
states, all opposition was withdrawn, as the existence of two branches
furnished a greater security to the lesser states. It does not appear; that
this division Or the legislative
</p>
<p>
 power became with the people any subject of ardent discussion, or of real
controversy. If it had been so, deep traces of it would have been found in
the public debates, instead of a general silence. The Federalist touches
the subject in but few places, and then principally with reference to the
articles of confederation, and the structure of the senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#30">
   30
  </a>
 </sup>
 In fact, the
opponents of the constitution felt, that there was additional security
given to the states, as such, by their representation in the senate; and as
the large states must have a commanding influence upon the actual basis in
the house, the lesser states could not but unite in a desire to maintain
their own equality in a co-ordinate branch.
 <sup>
  <a href="#31">
   31
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 560.
 </b>
 Having considered the general reasoning, by which the
division of
the legislative power has been justified, it may be proper, in conclusion,
to give a summary of those grounds, which were deemed most important, and
which had most influence in settling the actual structure of the
constitution of the United States. The question of course had reference
altogether to the establishment of the senate; for no one doubted the
propriety of establishing a house of representatives, as a depositary of
the legislative power, however much any might differ, as to the nature of
its composition.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 561.
 </b>
 In order to justify the existence of a senate with
co-ordinate
powers, it was said, first, that it was a misfortune incident to republican
governments, though in a less degree than to other governments, that those,
who administer it, may forget their obligations to their constituents, and
prove unfaithful to their important trust. In this point of view, a senate,
as a second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and
</p>
<p>
 dividing the power with a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on
the government. It doubles the security to the people by requiring the
concurrence of two distinct bodies, in schemes of usurpation or perfidy,
whereas the ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient.
This precaution, it was added, was founded on such clear principles, and so
well understood in the United States, that it was superfluous to enlarge on
it. As the improbability of sinister combinations would be in proportion to
the dissimilarity in the genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to
distinguish them from each other by every circumstance, which would consist
with a due harmony in all proper measures, and with the genuine principles
of republican government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#32">
   32
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 562.
 </b>
 Secondly. The necessity of a senate was not less
indicated by the
propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to the impulse of
sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by factious leaders into
intemperate and pernicious resolutions. Examples of this sort might be
cited without number, and from proceedings in the United States, as well as
from the history of other nations. A body, which is to correct this
infirmity, ought to be free from it, and consequently ought to be less
numerous, and to possess a due degree of firmness, and a proper tenure of
office.
 <sup>
  <a href="#33">
   33
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 563.
 </b>
 Thirdly. Another. defect to be supplied by a senate lay
in the want
of a due acquaintance with the objects and principles of legislation. A
good government implies two things; fidelity to the objects of the
</p>
<p>
 government; secondly, a knowledge of the means, by which those objects can
be best attained. It was suggested, that in the American governments too
little attention had been paid to the last; and that the establishment of a
senate upon a proper basis would greatly increase the chances of fidelity,
and of wise and safe legislation. What (it was asked) are all the
repealing, explaining, and amending laws, which fill and disgrace our
voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient wisdom; so many
impeachments exhibited by each succeeding, against each preceding session;
so many admonitions to the people of the value of those aids, which may be
expected from a well-constituted senate?
 <sup>
  <a href="#34">
   34
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 564.
 </b>
 Fourthly. Such a body would prevent too great a
mutability in the
public councils, arising from a rapid succession of new members; for from a
change of men there must proceed a change of opinions, and from a change of
opinions, a change of measures. Such instability in legislation has a
tendency to diminish respect and confidence abroad, as well as safety and
prosperity at home. It has a tendency to damp the ardour of industry and
enterprise; to diminish the security of property; and to impair the
reverence and attachment, which are indispensable to the permanence of
every political institution.
 <sup>
  <a href="#35">
   35
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 565.
 </b>
 Fifthly. Another ground, illustrating the utility of a
senate, was
suggested to be the keeping alive of a due sense of national character. In
respect to foreign nations, this was of vital importance; for in our
intercourse with them, if a scrupulous and uniform adherence to just
principles was not observed, it must sub-
</p>
<p>
 ject us to many embarrassments and collisions. It is difficult to impress
upon a single body, which is numerous and changeable, a deep sense of the
value of national character. A small portion of the praise, or blame of any
particular measure can fall to the lot of any particular person; and the
period of office is so short, that little responsibility is felt, and
little pride is indulged, as to the course of the government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#36">
   36
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 566.
 </b>
 Sixthly. It was urged, that paradoxical as it might
seem, the want
in some important cases of a due responsibility in the government arises
from that very frequency of elections, which in other cases produces such
responsibility. In order to he reasonable, responsibility must be limited
to objects within the power of the responsible party; and in order to be
effectual, it must relate to operations of that power, of which a ready and
proper judgment can be formed by the constituents. Some measures have
singly an immediate and sensible operation; others again depend on a
succession of well connected schemes, and have a gradual, and perhaps
unobserved operation. If, therefore, there be but one assembly, chosen for
a short period, it will be difficult to keep up the train of proper
measures, or to preserve the proper connexion between the past and the
future. And the more numerous the body, and the more changeable its
component parts, the more difficult it will be to preserve the personal
responsibility, as well as the uniform action, of the successive members to
the great objects of the public welfare.
 <sup>
  <a href="#37">
   37
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 567.
 </b>
 Lastly. A senate duly constituted would not only
operate, as a
salutary check upon the representa-
</p>
<p>
 tives, but occasionally upon the people themselves, against their own
temporary delusions and errors. The cool, deliberate sense of the community
ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free governments,
ultimately prevail over the views of their rulers. But there are particular
moments in public affairs, when the people, stimulated by some irregular
passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful
misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures, which they
themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In
these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of a body of
respectable citizens, chosen without reference to the exciting, cause, to
check the misguided career of public opinion, and to suspend the blow,
until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public
mind.
 <sup>
  <a href="#38">
   38
  </a>

 It was thought to add great weight to all these considerations,
that history has informed us of no longlived republic, which had not a
senate. Sparta, Rome, Carthage were, in fact, the only states, to whom that
character can be applied.

  § 568.
 </b>
 It will be observed, that some parts of the foregoing,
reasoning
apply to the fundamental importance or an actual division or the
legislative power; and other parts to the true principle, upon which that
division should be subsequently organized, in order to give full effect to
the constitutional check. Some parts go to show the value of a senate; and
others, what should be its structure, in order to ensure wisdom,
experience, fidelity, and dignity in its members. All of it, however,
instructs us, that, in order to give it fair play and influence, as a
co-ordinate branch of government, it ought to be less numerous, more
select, and more durable, than the other branch; and be chosen in a manner,
which should combine, and represent different interests with a varied
force.

 How far these objects are attained by the constitution will be
better seen, when the details belonging to each department are successively
examined.

  § 569.
 </b>
 This discussion may be closed by the remark, that in
the Roman
republic the legislative authority, in the last resort, resided for ages in
two distinct political bodies, not as branches of the same legislature, but
as distinct and independent legislatures, in each of which an opposite
interest prevailed. In one, the patrician;
</p>
<p>
 in the other, the plebeian predominated. And yet, during the co-existence
of these two legislatures, the Roman republic attained to the supposed
pinnacle of human greatness.

<li><a id="13"></a> The facility, with which even great men satisfy themselves with
exceeding their constitutional powers, was never better exemplified, than
by Mr. Jefferson's own practice and example, as stated in his own
correspondence. In 1802, he entered into a treaty, by which Louisiana was
to become a part of the Union, although (as we have seen) in his own
opinion, it was unconstitutional.*  And, in 1810, he contended for the
right of the executive to purchase Florida, if, in his own opinion, the
opportunity would otherwise be lost, notwithstanding it might involve a
transgression of the law.#  Such are the examples given of a state
necessity, which is to supersede the constitution and laws. Such are the
principles, which he contended, justified him in an arrest of persons not
sanctioned by law.+ * 4 Jefferson's Corresp. 1, 2, 3, 4 .Id. 149, 150 .Id. 151.</li>

discussed.* De Lolme, in his work on the constitution of England, has (ch.

passage already cited. He has added: "The result of a division of the

subject in the reasoning of the convention, in the county of Essex, called
to consider the constitution proposed for Massachusetts, in 1778,* and
which was finally rejected. The legislative power," said that body, " mast

influenced by the vices, follies, passions, and prejudices of an
individual. It is liable to be avaricious, and to exempt itself from the

themselves from annual to septennial; then for life; and finally exerted
the power of filling up all vacancies, without application to their
constituents. The government of Holland is now a tyranny, though a
republic. The result of a single assembly will be hasty and indigested; and
their judgments frequently absurd and inconsistent. There must be a second

independent upon the first, either for their creation, or existence. Yet
the first must retain a right to a similar revision and control over the
