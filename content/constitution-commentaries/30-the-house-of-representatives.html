 § 570. THE second section of the first article contains the
structure and
organization of the house of representatives. The first clause is as
follows:
</p>
<p>
 "The house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every
second year by the people of the several states; and the electors in each
state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most
numerous branch of the state legislature."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 571.
 </b>
 As soon as it was settled, that the legislative power
should be
divided into two separate and distinct branches, a very important
consideration arose in regard to the organization of those branches
respectively. It is obvious, that the organization of each is susceptible
of very great diversities and modifications, in respect to the principles
of representation; the qualification of the electors, and the elected; the
term of service of the members; the ratio of representation; and the
number, of which the body should be composed.
</p>
<b>
 § 572.
</b>
First; the principle of representation. The American
people had
long been in the enjoyment of the privilege of electing, at least, one
branch of the legislature; and, in some of the colonies, of electing all
the branches composing the legislature. A house of representatives, under
various denominations, such as a house of delegates, a house of commons,
or, simply, a house of representatives, emanating directly from, and
responsible to, the people, and possessing a distinct and independent
legislative authority, was familiar to all the colonies, and was held by
them in the highest rever-
<p>
 ence and respect. They justly thought, that as the government in general
should always have a common interest with the people, and be administered
for their good; so it was essential to their rights and liberties, that the
most numerous branch should have an immediate dependence upon, and sympathy
with the people.
 <sup>

 </sup>
 There was no novelty in this view. It was not the mere
result of a state of colonial dependence in which their jealousy was awake
to all the natural encroachments of power in a foreign realm. They had
drawn their opinions and principles from the practice of the parent
country. They knew the inestimable value of the house of commons, as a
component branch of the British parliament; and they believed, that it had
at all times furnished the best security against the oppressions of the
crown, and the aristocracy. While the power of taxation, of revenue, and of
supplies, remained in the hands of a popular branch, it was difficult for
usurpation to exist for any length of time without check; and prerogative
must yield to that necessity which controlled at once the sword and the
purse. No reasoning, therefore, was necessary to satisfy the American
people of the advantages of a house of representatives, which should
emanate directly from themselves; which should guard their interests,
support their rights, express their opinions, make known their wants,
redress their grievances, and introduce a pervading popular influence
throughout all the operations of the government. Experience, as well as
theory, had settled it in their minds, as a fundamental principle of a free
government, and especially of a republican government, that no laws
</p>
<p>
 ought to be passed without the co-operation and consent of the
representatives of the people; and that these representatives should be
chosen by themselves without the intervention of any other functionaries to
intercept, or vary their responsibility.

 <b>
  § 473.
 </b>
 The principle, however, had been hitherto applied to
the political
organization of the state legislatures only; and its application to that of
the federal government was not without some diversity of opinion. This
diversity had not its origin in any doubt of the correctness of the
principle itself, when applied to simple republics; but, the propriety of
applying it to cases of confederated republics was affected by other
independent considerations. Those, who might wish to retain a very large
portion of state sovereignty, in its representative character, in the
councils of the Union, would naturally desire to have the house of
representatives elected by the state in its political character, as under
the old confederation. Those, on the other hand, who wished to impart to
the government a national character, would as naturally desire an
independent election by the people themselves in their primary meetings.
Probably these circumstances had some operation upon the votes given on the
question in the convention itself. For it appears, that upon the original
proposition in the convention, "That the members of the first branch of the
national legislature ought to be elected by the people of the several
states, six states voted for it, two against it, and two were divided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#3">

  </a>
 </sup>
 And upon a subsequent motion to strike out the word "people," and insert in
its place the word "legislatures,"
</p>
<p>
 three states voted in the affirmative and eight in the negative.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">
   4
  </a>
 </sup>
 At a
subsequent period a motion, that the representatives should be appointed in
such manner as the legislature of each state should direct, was negatived,
six states voting in the affirmative, three in the negative, and one being
divided; and the final vote in favour of an election by the people was
decided by the vote of nine states in the affirmative, one voting in the
negative, and one being divided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#5">

 The result was not therefore obtained
without much discussion and argument; though at last an entire unanimity
prevailed.
 <sup>
  <a href="#6">

 It is satisfactory to know, that a fundamental principle of
public liberty has been thus secured to ourselves and our posterity, which
will for ever indissolubly connect the interests of the people with the
interests of the Union.

 Under the confederation, though the delegates to
congress might have been elected by the people, they were, in fact, in all
the states except two, elected by the state legislature.

  §574.
 </b>
 We accordingly find, that in the section under
consideration, the
house of representatives is required to be composed of representatives
chosen by the people of the several states. The choice, too, is to be made
immediately by them; so that the power is direct; the influence direct; and
the responsibility direct. If any intermediate agency had been adopted,
such as a choice through an electoral college, or by official personages,
or by select and specially qualified functionaries pro hac vice, it is
obvious, that the dependence of the representative upon the people, and the
responsibility to them, would have been far less felt, and far more
obstructed. Influence would have naturally grown up with patronage; and
here, as in many other cases, the legal maxim would have applied, causa
proxima, non remota, spectalur. The select body would have been at once the
patrons and the guides of the representative; and the people themselves
have become the instruments of subverting their own rights and power.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 575.
 </b>
 The indirect advantages from this immediate agency of
the people in
the choice of their representatives are of incalculable benefit, and
deserve a brief mention in this place, because they furnish us with matter
for most serious reflection, in regard to the actual operations and
influences of republican governments. In the first place, the right confers
an additional sense of personal dignity and duty upon the mass of the
people. It gives a strong direction to the education, studies, and pursuits
of the whole community. It enlarges the sphere of action, and contributes,
in a high degree, to the formation of the public manners, and national
character. It procures to the common people courtesy and sympathy from
their superiors, and diffuses a common confidence, as well as a
</p>
<p>
 common interest, through all the ranks of society. It awakens a desire to
examine, and sift, and debate all public proceedings, and thus nourishes a
lively curiosity to acquire knowledge, and, at the same time, furnishes the
means of gratifying it. The proceedings and debates of the legislature; the
conduct of public officers from the highest to the lowest; the character
and conduct of the executive and his ministers; the struggles, intrigues,
and conduct of different parties; and the discussion of the great public
measures and questions, which agitate and divide the community, are not
only freely canvassed, and thus improve and elevate conversation; but they
gradually furnish the mind with safe and solid materials for judgment upon
all public affairs; and check that impetuosity and rashness, to which
sudden impulses might otherwise lead the people, when they are artfully
misguided by selfish demagogues, and plausible schemes of change.

  § 576.
 </b>
 But this fundamental principle of an immediate choice by the
people, however important, would alone be insufficient for the public
security, if the right of choice had not many auxiliary guards and
accompaniments. It was indispensable, secondly, to provide for the
qualifications of the electors. It is obvious, that even when the principle
is established, that the popular branch of the legislature shall emanate
directly from the people, there still remains a very serious question, by
whom and in what manner the choice shall be made. It is a question vital to
the system, and in a practical sense decisive, as to the durability and
efficiency of the powers of government. Here, there is much room for doubt,
and ingenious speculation, and theoretical inqui-
</p>
<p>
 ry; upon which different minds may arrive, and indeed have arrived, at very
different results. To whom ought the right of suffrage, in a free
government, to be confided? Or, in other words, who ought to be permitted
to vote in the choice of the representatives of the people?  Ought the
right of suffrage to be absolutely universal? Ought it to be qualified and
restrained? Ought it to belong to many, or few? If there ought to be
restraints and qualifications, what are the true boundaries and limits of
such restraints and qualifications?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 577.
 </b>
 These questions are sufficiently perplexing and
disquieting in
theory; and in the practice of different states, and even of free states,
ancient as well as modern, they have assumed almost infinite varieties of
form and illustration. Perhaps they do not admit of any general, much less
of any universal answer, so as to furnish an unexceptionable and certain
rule for all ages and all nations. The manners, habits, institutions,
characters, and pursuits of different nations; the local position of the
territory, in regard to a nations; the actual organizations and classes of
society; the influences of peculiar religious, civil, or political
institutions; the dangers, as well as the difficulties, of the times; the
degrees of knowledge or ignorance pervading the mass of society; the
national temperament, and even the climate and products of the soil; the
cold and thoughtful gravity of the north; and the warm and mercurial
excitability of tropical or southern regions; all these may, and probably
will, introduce modifications of principle, as well as of opinion, in
regard to the right of suffrage, which it is not easy either to justify or
to overthrow.

 <b>
  § 578.
 </b>
 The most strenuous advocate for universal suffrage has never yet
contended, that the right should be absolutely universal. No one has ever
been sufficiently visionary to hold, that all persons, of every age,
degree, and character, should be entitled to vote in all elections of all
public officers. Idiots, infants, minors, and persons insane or utterly
imbecile, have been, without scruple, denied the right, as not having the
sound judgment and discretion fit for its exercise. In many countries,
persons guilty of crimes have also been denied the right, as a personal
punishment, or as a security to society. In most countries, females,
whether married or single, have been purposely excluded from voting, as
interfering with sound policy, and the harmony of social life. In the few
cases in which they have been permitted to vote, experience has not
justified the conclusion, that it has been attended with any correspondent
advantages, either to the public, or to themselves. And yet it would be
extremely difficult, upon any mere theoretical reasoning, to establish any
satisfactory principle,
</p>
<p>
 upon which the one half of every society has thus been systematically
excluded by the other half from all right of participating in government,
which would not, at the same time, apply to and justify many other
exclusions. If it be said, that all men have a natural, equal, and
unalienable right to vote, because they are all born free and equal; that
they all have common rights and interests entitled to protection, and
therefore have an equal right to decide, either personally or by their
chosen representatives, upon the laws and regulations, which shall control,
measure, and sustain those rights and interests; that they cannot be
compelled to surrender, except by their free consent, what, by the bounty
and order of Providence, belongs to them in common with all their race; --
what is there in these considerations, which is not equally applicable to
females, as free, intelligent, moral, responsible beings, entitled to equal
rights, and interests, and protection, and having a vital stake in all the
regulations and laws of society? And if an exception, from the nature of
the case, could be felt in regard to persons, who are idiots, infants, and
insane; how can this apply to persons, who are of more mature growth, and
are yet deemed minors by the municipal law? Who has an original right to
fix the time and period of pupilage, or minority? Whence was derived the
right of the ancient Greeks and Romans to declare, that women should be
deemed never to be of age, but should be subject to perpetual guardianship?
Upon what principle of natural law did the Romans, in after times, fix the
majority of females, as well as of males, at twentyfive years?
 <sup>
  <a href="#11">
   11
  </a>
 </sup>
 Who has a
right to say that in England it shall, for some purposes, be at fourteen,
for others, at seventeen, and for all, at twenty-one years; while, in
</p>
<p>
 France, a person arrives, for all purposes, at majority, only at thirty
years, in Naples at eighteen, and in Holland at twenty-five?
 <sup>
  <a href="#12">
   12
  </a>
 </sup>
 Who shall
say, that one man is not as well qualified, as a voter, at eighteen years
of age, as another is at twenty-five, or third at forty; and far better,
than most men are at eighty? And if any society is invested with authority
to settle the matter of the age and sex of voters, according to its own
view of its policy, or convenience, or justice, who shall say, that it has
not equal authority, for like reasons, to settle any other matter regarding
the rights, qualifications, and duties of voters?
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 579.
 </b>
 The truth seems to be, that the right of voting, like
many other
rights, is one which, whether it has a fixed foundation in natural law or
not, has always been treated in the practice of nations, as a strictly
civil right, derived from, and regulated by each society, according to its
own circumstances and interests.
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is difficult, even in the abstract,
to conceive how it could have otherwise been treated. The terms and
conditions, upon which any society is formed and organized, must
essentially depend upon the will of those, who are associated; or at least
of those, who constitute a majority, actually controlling the rest.
Originally, no man could have any right but to act for himself; and the
power to choose a chief magistrate or other officer to exercise dominion or
authority over others, as well as himself, could arise only upon a joint
consent of the others to such appointment; and their consent might be
qualified exactly according, to their
</p>
<p>
 own interests, or power, or policy. The choice of representatives to act in
a legislative capacity is not only a refinement of much later stages of
actual association and civilization, but could scarcely occur, until the
society had assumed to itself the right to introduce such institutions, and
to confer such privileges, as it deemed conducive to the public good, and
to prohibit the existence of any other. In point of fact, it is well known,
that representative legislative bodies, at least in the form now used, are
the peculiar invention of modern times, and were unknown to antiquity. If,
then, every well organized society has the right to consult for the common
good of the whole, and if, upon the principles of natural law, this right
is conceded by the very union of society, it seems difficult to assign any
limit to this right, which is compatible with the due attainment of the end
proposed. If, therefore, any society shall deem the common good and
interests of the whole society best promoted under the particular
circumstances, in which it is placed, by a restriction of the right of
suffrage, it is not easy to state any solid ground of objection to its
exercise of such an authority. At least, if any society has a clear right
to deprive females, constituting one half of the whole population, from the
right of suffrage, (which, with scarcely an exception, has been uniformly
maintained,) it will require some astuteness to find upon what ground this
exclusion can bevindicated, which does justify, or at least excuse, many
other exclusions.

 Government (to use the pithy language of Mr. Burke)

  § 580.
 </b>
 Without laying any stress upon this theoretical
reasoning, which is
brought before the reader, not so much because it solves all doubts and
objections, as because it presents a view of the serious difficulties
attendant upon the assumption of an original and unalienable right of
suffrage, as originating in natural law, and independent of civil law, it
may be proper to state, that every civilized society has uniformly fixed,
modified, and regulated the right of suffrage for itself, according to its
own free will and pleasure. Every constitution of government in these
United States has assumed, as a fundamental principle, the right of the
people of the state to alter, abolish, and modify the form of its own
government, according, to the sovereign pleasure of the people.
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">
   17
  </a>
 </sup>
 In fact,
the people of each state have gone much farther, and settled a far more
critical question, by deciding, who shall be the voters, entitled to
approve and reject the constitution framed by a delegated body under their
direction. In the adoption of no state constitution has the assent been
asked of any but the qualified voters; and women, and minors, and other
persons, not recognized as voters by existing laws, have been studiously
excluded. And yet the constitution has been deemed entirely obligatory upon
them, as well as upon the minority, who voted against it. From this it will
be seen, how little, even in the most free of republican governments, any
abstract right of suffrage, or any original and indefeasible privilege, has
been recognized in practice. If this consideration
</p>
<p>
 does not satisfy our minds, it at least will prepare us to presume, that
there may be an almost infinite diversity in the established right of
voting, without any state being able to assert, that its own mode is
exclusively founded in natural justice, or is most conformable to sound
policy, or is best adapted to the public security. It will teach us, that
the question is necessarily complex and intricate in its own nature, and is
scarcely susceptible of any simple solution, which shall rigidly apply to
the circumstances and conditions, the interests and the feelings, the
institutions and the manners of all nations.

 What may best promote the
public weal, and secure the public liberty, and advance the public
prosperity in one age or nation, may totally fail of similar results under
local, physical, or moral predicaments essentially different.

 <b>
  § 581.
 </b>
 It would carry us too far from the immediate object of these
Commentaries to take a general survey Or the various modifications, under
which the right of suffrage, either in relation to laws, or magistracy, or
even judicial controversies, has appeared in different nations in ancient
and modern times. The examples of Greece and Rome, in ancient times, and of
England in modern times, will be found most instructive.
 <sup>
  <a href="#19">

 In England, the
qualifications of voters, as also the modes of representation, are various,
and framed upon no common principle. The counties are represented by
knights, elected by the proprietors of lands, who are freeholders;
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">
   20
  </a>
 </sup>
 the
boroughs and cities are represented
</p>
<p>
 by citizens and burgesses, or others chosen by the citizens or burgesses,
according to the qualifications prescribed by custom, or by the respective
charters and by-laws of each borough, or city.
 <sup>
  <a href="#21">
   21
  </a>
 </sup>
 In these, the right of
voting is almost infinitely varied and modified.
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the American
colonies, under their charters and laws, no uniform rules in regard to the
right of suffrage existed. In some of the colonies the course of the parent
country was closely followed, so that freeholders alone were voters;
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
 in
others a very near approach was made to universal suffrage among the males
of competent age; and in others, again, a middle principle was adopted,
which made taxation and voting dependent upon each other, or annexed to it
the qualification of holding some personal estate, or the privilege of
being a freeman, or the eldest son of a freeholder of the town or
corporation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">
   24
  </a>
 </sup>
 When the revolution brought about the separation of the
colonies, and they formed themselves into independent states, a very
striking diversity was observable in the original constitutions adopted by
them;
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 and a like diversity has pervaded all the constitutions of the new
states, which have since grown up, and all the revised constitutions of the
old states, which have received the final ratification of the people. In
some of the states the right of suffrage
</p>
<p>
 depends upon a certain length of residence, and payment of taxes; in
others, upon mere citizenship and residence; in others, upon the possession
of a freehold, or some estate of a particular value, or upon the payment of
taxes, or performance of some public duty, such as service in the militia,
or on the highways.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">
   26
  </a>
 </sup>
 In no two of these state constitutions will it be
found, that the qualifications of the voters are settled upon the same
uniform basis.
 <sup>
  <a href="#27">
   27
  </a>
 </sup>
 So that we have the most abundant proofs, that among a
free and enlightened people, convened for the purpose of establishing their
own forms of government, and the rights of their own voters, the question,
as to the due regulation of the qualifications, has been deemed a matter of
mere state policy, and varied to meet the wants, to suit the prejudices,
and to roster the interests of the majority. An absolute, indefeasible
right to elect or be elected, seems never to have been asserted on one
side, or denied on the other; but the subject has been freely canvassed, as
one of mere civil polity, to be arranged upon such a basis, as the majority
may deem expedient with reference to the moral, physical, and intellectual
condition of the particular state.

 <b>
  § 582.
 </b>
 It was under this known diversity of constitutional
provisions in
regard to state elections, that the convention, which framed the
constitution of the Union,
</p>
<p>
 was assembled. The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly
regarded, as a fundamental article of a republican government. It was
incumbent on the convention, therefore, to define and establish this right
in the constitution. To have left it open for the occasional regulation of
congress would have been improper, for the reason just mentioned. To have
submitted it to the legislative discretion of the states, would have been
improper, for the same reason; and for the additional reason, that it would
have rendered too dependent on the state governments, that branch of the
federal government, which ought to be dependent on the people alone.
 <sup>
  <a href="#29">
   29
  </a>
 </sup>
 Two
modes of providing for the right of suffrage in the choice of
representatives were presented to the consideration of that body. One was
to devise some plan, which should operate uniformly in all the states, on a
common principle; the other was to conform to the existing diversities in
the states, thus creating a mixed mode of representation. In favour of the
former course, it might be urged, that all the states ought, upon the floor
of the house of representatives, to be represented equally; that this could
be accomplished only by the adoption of a uniform qualification of the
voters, who would thus express the same public opinion of the same body of
citizens throughout the Union; that if freeholders alone in one state chose
the representatives; and in another all male citizens of competent age; and
in another all freemen of particular towns or corporations; and in another
all taxed inhabitants; it would be obvious, that different interests and
classes would obtain exclusive representations in different states; and
thus the great objects of the
</p>
<p>
 constitution, the promotion of the general welfare and common defence,
might be unduly checked and obstructed; that a uniform principle would at
least have this recommendation, that it could create no wellfounded
jealousies among the different states, and would be most likely to satisfy
the body of the people by its perfect fairness, its permanent equality of
operation, and its entire independence of all local legislation, whether in
the shape of state laws; or of amendments to state constitutions.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 583.
 </b>
 On the other hand, it might be urged in favour of the latter
course, that the reducing of the different qualifications, already existing
in the different states, to one uniform rule, would have been a very
difficult task, even to the convention itself, and would be dissatisfactory
to the people of different states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#30">
   30
  </a>
 </sup>
 It would not be very easy for the
convention to frame any rule, which would satisfy the scruples, the
prejudices, or the judgments of a majority of its own members. It would not
be easy to induce Virginia to give up the exclusive right of freeholders to
vote; or Rhode-Island, or Connecticut, the exclusive right of freemen to
vote; or Massachusetts, the right of persons possessing a given value of
personal property to vote; or other states, the right of persons paying
taxes, or having a fixed residence, to vote. The subject itself was not
susceptible of any very exact limitations upon any general reasoning. The
circumstances of different states might create great diversities in the
practical operation of any uniform system. And the natural attachments,
which long habit and usage had sanctioned, in regard to the exercise of the
</p>
<p>
 right, would enlist all the feelings, and interests, and opinions of every
state against any substantial change in its own institutions. A great
embarrassment would be thus thrown in the way of the adoption of the
constitution itself, which perhaps would be thus put at hazard, upon the
mere ground of theoretical propriety.

<p>
 <b>
  §584.
 </b>
 Besides; it might be urged, that it is far from being clear, upon
reasoning or experience, that uniformity in the composition of a
representative body is either more promotive of the general good, than a
mixed system, embracing, and representing, and combining distinct
interests, classes, and opinions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#32">
   32
  </a>
 </sup>
 In England the house of commons, as a
representative body, is founded upon no uniform principle, either of
numbers, or classes, or
</p>
<p>
 places.
 <sup>
  <a href="#33">
   33
  </a>
 </sup>
 The representation is made up of persons chosen by electors
having, very different, and sometimes very discordant qualifications; in
some cases, property is exclusively represented; in others, particular
trades and pursuits; in others, inhabitancy and corporate privileges; in
others, the reverse. In some cases, the representatives are chosen by very
numerous voters; in others, by very few; in some cases, a single patron
possesses the exclusive power of choosing representatives, as in nomination
boroughs; in others, very populous cities have no right to choose any
representatives at all; in some cases, a select body, forming a very small
part of the inhabitants, has the exclusive right of choice; in others,
non-residents can control the whole election; in some places a half million
of inhabitants possess the right to choose no more representatives, than
are assigned to the most insignificant borough, with scarcely an inhabitant
to point out its local limits.
 <sup>
  <a href="#34">

 </sup>
 Yet this inequality has never, of itself,
been deemed an exclusive evil in Great Britain.
 <sup>
  <a href="#35">
   35
  </a>
 </sup>
 And in every system of
reform, which has found public favour in that country, many of these
diversities have been embodied from choice, as important checks upon undue
legislation, as facilitating the representation of different interests, and
</p>
<p>
 different opinions; and as thus securing, by a well-balanced and
intelligent representation of all the various classes of society, a
permanent protection of the public liberties of the people, and a firm
security of the private rights of persons and property.

therefore, asserting, that such a mixed representation is absolutely, and
under all circumstances, the best, it might be safely affirmed, that the
existence of various elements in the composition of the representative body
is not necessarily inexpedient, unjust, or insecure; and, in many cases,
may promote a wholesome restraint upon partial plans of legislation, and
ensure a vigorous growth to the general interests of the Union. The
planter, the farmer, the mechanic, the merchant, and the manufacturer might
thus be brought to act together, in a body representing each; and thus
superior intelligence, as well as mutual good-will and respect, be diffused
through the whole of the collective body.

  § 585.

 In the judgment of the convention, this latter
reasoning seems to
have obtained a decisive influence,
</p>
<p>
 and to have established the final result; and it was accordingly declared,
in the clause under consideration, that " the electors in each state shall
have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch
of the state legislature."
 <sup>
  <a href="#38">
   38
  </a>
 </sup>
 Upon this clause (which was finally adopted by
a unanimous vote) the Federalist has remarked, "the provision made by the
convention appears to be the best, that lay within their option. It must be
satisfactory to every state, because it is conformable to the standard
already established by the state itself. It will be safe to the United
States, because, being fixed by the state constitutions, it is not
alterable by the state governments; and it cannot be feared, that the
people of the states will alter this part of their constitutions in such a
manner, as to abridge the rights secured to them by the federal
constitution."
 <sup>
  <a href="#39">
   39
  </a>
 </sup>
 The remark, in a general sense, is true; but the provision
has not, in fact, and may not have, all the security against alteration by
the state governments, which is so confidently affirmed. At the time, when
it was made, Connecticut and Rhode-Island were acting under the royal
charters of 1662 and 1663; and their legislatures possessed the power of
modifying, from time to time, the right of suffrage. Rhode-Island yet
continues without any written constitution, unless the charter of 1663 is
to be deemed such. In Maryland successive legislatures may change the form
of government; and in other states amendments may be, and indeed have been
adopted,
</p>
<p>
 materially varying the rights of suffrage.
 <sup>
  <a href="#40">
   40
  </a>
 </sup>
 So that absolute stability is
not to be predicated of the existing modes of suffrage; though there is
little practical danger of any changes, which would work unfavourably to
popular rights.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 586.
 </b>
 In the third place, the term of service of
representatives. In
order to ensure permanent safety to the liberties of the people, other
guards are indispensable, besides those, which are derived from the
exercise of the right of suffrage and representation. If, when the
legislature is once chosen, it is perpetual, or may last during the life of
the representatives; and in case of death, or resignation only, the vacancy
is to be supplied by the election of new representatives; it is easy to
perceive, that in such cases there will be but a very slight check upon
their acts, on the part of the people. In such cases, if the legislative
body should be once corrupted, the evil would be past all remedy, at least
without some violent revolution, or extraordinary calamity.
 <sup>
  <a href="#41">
   41
  </a>
 </sup>
 But, when
different legislative bodies are to succeed each other at short intervals,
if the people disapprove of the present, they may rectify its faults, by
the silent exercise of their power in the succeeding election. Besides, a
legislative assembly, which is sure to be separated again, and its members
soon return to private life, will feel its own interests, as well as
duties, bound up with those of the community at large.
 <sup>
  <a href="#42">
   42
  </a>
 </sup>
 It may, therefore,
be safely laid down, as a fundamental axiom of republican governments, that
there must be a dependence on, and responsibility to, the people, on the
part of the representative, which shall constantly  exert an influence upon
</p>
<p>
 his acts and opinions, and produce a sympathy between him and his
constituents.
 <sup>
  <a href="#43">
   43
  </a>
 </sup>
 If, when he is once elected, he holds his place for life,
or during good behaviour, or for a long period of years, it is obvious,
that there will be little effective control exercised upon him; and he will
soon learn to disregard the wishes, the interests, and even the rights of
his constituents, whenever they interfere with his own selfish pursuits and
objects. When appointed, he may not, indeed, consider himself, as
exclusively their representative, bound by their opinions, and devoted to
their peculiar local interests, although they may be wholly inconsistent
with the good of the Union. He ought rather to deem himself a
representative of the nation, and bound to provide for the general welfare,
and to consult for the general safety.
 <sup>
  <a href="#44">
   44
  </a>
 </sup>
 But still; in a just sense, he
ought to feel his responsibility to them, and to act for them in common
wish the rest of the people; and to deem himself, in an emphatic manner,
their defender, and their friend.
 <sup>

 Frequent elections are unquestionably the soundest, if

 But the
question, what degree of frequency is best calculated to accomplish that
object is not susceptible of any precise and universal answer, and must
essentially depend upon very different considerations in different nations,

 It has been a current observation, that " where annual

 <sup>

 </sup>
 But this remark, like many others of a general
nature, is open to much question. There is no pretence, that there is any
natural connexion between the period of a year, or any other exact
revolution of time, and the political changes fit for governments or
magistrates. Why is the election of a magistrate or representative more
safe for one year, than for two years? For one year, more than for six
months? For six months, more than for three months? It is certainly
competent for a state to elect its own rulers, daily, or weekly, or
monthly, or annual-
</p>
<p>
 ly, or for a longer period, if it is deemed expedient. In this respect, it
must be, or ought to be, governed by its own convenience, interests, and
safety. It is, therefore, a question of sound policy, dependent upon
circumstances, and not resolvable into any absolute elements dependent upon
the revolution or return of natural seasons.
 <sup>
  <a href="#49">
   49
  </a>
 </sup>
 The aim of every political
constitution is, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men, who
possess most wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue the common good
of the society; and, in the next place, to take the most effectual
precautions for keeping them virtuous, whilst they continue their public
trust.
 <sup>
  <a href="#51">
   51
  </a>
 </sup>
 Various means may be resorted to for this purpose; and doubtless
one of the most efficient is the frequency of elections. But who is there,
that will not perceive, upon the slightest examination of the subject, what
a wide space there is for the exercise of discretion, and for diversity of
judgment.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 589.
 </b>
 Without pretending to go into a complete survey of the subject, in
all its bearings, the frequency of elections may be materially affected, as
matter of policy, by the extent of the population and territory of a
country, the concentration or sparseness of the population, the nature of
the pursuits, and employments, and engagements of the people; and by the
local and political situation of the nation in regard to contiguous
nations. If the government be of small extent, or be concentrated in a
single city, it will be far more easy for the citizens to choose their
rulers frequently, and to change them without mischief, than it would be,
if the territory were large, the population sparse, and the means
</p>
<p>
 of intercourse few and liable to interruption. If all the inhabitants, who
are to vote, reside in towns and villages there will be little
inconvenience in assembling together at a short notice to make a choice. It
will be far otherwise, if the inhabitants are scattered over a large
territory, and are engaged in agricultural pursuits, like the planters and
farmers of the southern and western states, who must meet at a distance
from their respective homes, and at some common place of assembling. In
cases of this sort, the sacrifice of time necessary to accomplish the
object, the expenses of the journey, the imperfect means of communication,
the slow progress of interchanges of opinion, would naturally diminish the
exercise of the right of suffrage. There would be great danger, under such
circumstances, that there would grow up a general indifference or
inattention to elections, it they were frequent, since they would create
little interest, and would involve heavy charges and burthens. The nature
of the pursuits and employments of the people must also have great
influence in settling the question. If the mass of the citizens are engaged
in employments, which take them away for a long period from home, such as
employments in the whale and cod fisheries, in the fur-trade, in foreign
and distant commerce, in periodical caravans, or in other pursuits, which
require constant attention, or long continued labours at particular
seasons; it is obvious, that frequent elections, which should interfere
with their primary interests and objects, would be at once inconvenient,
oppressive, and unequal. They would enable the few to obtain a complete
triumph and ascendency in the affairs of the state over the many. Besides,
the frequency of elections must be subject to other considerations,
affecting the general comfort and convenience, as well
</p>
<p>
 of rulers, as of electors. In the bleak regions of Lapland, and the farther
north, and in the sultry and protracted heats of the south, a due regard
must be had to the health of the inhabitants, and to the ordinary means of
travelling. If the territory be large, the representatives must come from
great distances, and are liable to be retarded by all the varieties of
climate, and geological features of the country; by drifts of impassable
snows; by sudden inundations; by chains of mountains; by extensive
prairies; by numerous streams; by sandy deserts.

  § 590.
 </b>
 The task of legislation, too, is exceedingly different
in a small
state, from what it is in a large one; in a state engaged in a single
pursuit, or living in pastoral simplicity, from what it is in a state
engaged in the infinitely varied employments of agriculture, manufacture,
and commerce, where enterprise and capital rapidly circulate; and new
legislation is constantly required by the new fortunes of society. A single
week might suffice for the ordinary legislation of a state of the
territorial extent of Rhode-Island; while several months would scarcely
suffice for that of New-York. In Great-Britain a half year is consumed in
legislation for its diversified interests and occupations; while a week
would accomplish all, that belongs to that of Lapland or Greenland, of the
narrow republic of Geneva, or of the subordinate principalities of Germany.
Athens might legislate, without obstructing the daily course of common
business, for her own meagre territory; but when Rome had become the
mistress of the world, the year seemed too short for all the exigencies of
her sovereignty. When she deliberated for a world, she
</p>
<p>
 felt, that legislation, to be wise or safe, must be slow and cautious; that
knowledge, as well as power, was indispensable for the true government of
her provinces.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 591.
 </b>
 Again; the local position of a nation in regard to
other nations
may require very different courses of legislation, and very different
intervals of elections, from what would be dictated by a sense of its own
interest and convenience under other circumstances. If it is surrounded by
powerful and warlike neighbours, its own government must be invested with
proportionately prompt means to act, and to legislate, in order to repel
aggressions, and secure its own rights. Frequent changes in the public
councils might not only leave it exposed to the hazard of having no
efficient body in existence to act upon any sudden emergency, but also, by
the fluctuations of opinion, necessarily growing out of these changes,
introduce imbecility, irresolution, and the want of due information into
those councils. Men, to act with vigour and effect, must have time to
mature measures, and judgment and experience, as to the best method of
applying them. They must not be hurried on to their conclusions by the
passions, or the fears of the multitude. They must deliberate, as well as
resolve. If the power drops from their hands before they have an
opportunity to carry any system into full effect, or even to put it on its
trial, it is impossible, that foreign nations should not be able, by
intrigues, by false alarms, and by corrupt influences, to defeat the wisest
measures of the best patriots.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 592.
 </b>
 One other consideration of a general nature deserves
attention. It
is, that while, on the one hand, constantly recurring elections afford a
great security to public liberty, they are not, on the other hand, without
some dangers and inconveniences of a formidable
</p>
<p>
 nature. The very frequency of elections has a tendency to create agitations
and dissensions in the public mind; to nourish factions, and encourage
restlessness, to favour rash innovations in domestic legislation and public
policy; and to produce violent and sudden changes in the administration of
public affairs, founded upon temporary excitements and prejudices.
 <sup>
  <a href="#53">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 593.
 </b>
 It is plain, that some of the considerations, which
have been
stated, must apply with very different force to the condition and interests
of different states; and they demonstrate, if not the absurdity, at least
the impolicy of laying down any general maxim, as to the frequency of
elections to legislative, or other offices.
 <sup>
  <a href="#54">
   54
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is quite as much
absurdity in laying down, as a general rule, that where annual elections
end, tyranny begins, as there is in saying, that the people are free only
while they are choosing their representatives, and slaves during the whole
period of their service.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 594.
 </b>
 If we examine this matter by the light of history, or
at least of
that portion of it, which is best entitled to instruct us on the point, it
will be found, that there is no uniformity of practice, or principle, among
free nations in regard to elections. In England it is not easy to trace out
any very decided course. The history of parliament, after magna charta,
proves, that that body had been accustomed usually to assemble once a year;
but, as these sessions were dependent upon the good pleasure and discretion
of the crown, very long and inconvenient intermissions occasionally
</p>
<p>
 occurred, from royal contrivance, ambition, or policy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#55">
   55
  </a>
 </sup>
 But, even when
parliament was accustomed to sit every year, the members were not chosen
every year. On the contrary, as the dissolution of parliament was solely
dependent on the will of the crown, it might, and formerly it sometimes did
happen, that a single parliament lasted through the whole life of the king,
who convened it.
 <sup>
  <a href="#56">
   56
  </a>
 </sup>
 To remedy these grievances, it was provided by a
statute, passed in the reign of Charles the Second, that the intermissions
should not be protracted beyond the period of three years; and by a
subsequent statute of William and Mary, that the same parliament should not
sit longer than three years, but be, at the end of that period, dissolved,
and a new one elected. This period was, by a statute of George the First,
prolonged to seven years, after an animated debate; and thus septennial
became a substitute for triennial parliaments.
 <sup>
  <a href="#57">
   57
  </a>
 </sup>
 Notwithstanding the
constantly increasing influence of the house of commons, and its popular
cast of opinion and action, more than a century has elapsed without any
successful effort, or even any general desire, to change the duration of
parliament. So that, as the English constitution now stands, the parliament
must expire, or die a natural death, at the end of the seventh year, and
not sooner, unless dissolved by the royal prerogative.
 <sup>
  <a href="#58">
   58
  </a>
 </sup>
 Yet no man,
tolerably well acquainted with the history of Great Britain for the last
century, would venture to affirm, that the people had not enjoyed a higher
degree of liberty and
</p>
<p>
 influence in all the proceedings of the government, than ever existed in
any antecedent period.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 595.
 </b>
 If we bring, our inquiries nearer home, it will be
found, that the
history of the American colonies before the revolution affords an equally
striking proof of the diversity of opinion and usage. It is very well
known, that the principle of representation in one branch of the
legislature was (as has been already stated) established in all the
colonies. But the periods of election of the representatives were very
different. They varied from a half-year to seven years. In Virginia the
elections were septennial; in North and SouthCarolina, biennial; in
Massachusetts, annual; in Connecticut and Rhode-Island, semi-annual.
 <sup>
  <a href="#59">
   59
  </a>
 </sup>
 It
has been very justly remarked by the Federalist, that there is not any
reason to infer, from the spirit and conduct of the representatives of the
people prior to the revolution, that biennial elections would have been
dangerous to the public liberties. The spirit, which every where displayed
itself at the commencement of the struggle, and which vanquished the
obstacles to independence, is the best of proofs, that a sufficient portion
of liberty had been every where enjoyed to inspire both a sense of its
worth, and a zeal for its proper enlargement. This remark holds good, as
well with regard to the then colonies, whose elections were least frequent,
as to those, whose elections were most frequent. Virginia was the colony,
which stood first in resisting the parliamentary encroachments of Great
Britain; it was the first also in espousing, by a public act, the
resolution of independence. Yet her house of representatives
</p>
<p>
 was septennial.
 <sup>
  <a href="#60">
   60
  </a>
 </sup>
 When, after the revolution, the states freely framed and
adopted their own constitutions of government, a similar, though not so
marked a diversity of opinion, was exhibited. In Connecticut, until her
recent constitution, the representatives were chosen semi-annually; in
Rhode-Island they are still chosen semi-annually; in South-Carolina,
Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, and Louisiana they are chosen biennially;
and in the rest of the states annually.
 <sup>
  <a href="#61">
   61
  </a>
 </sup>
 And it has been justly observed
in the Federalist,
 <sup>
  <a href="#62">
   62
  </a>
 </sup>
 that it would not be easy to show, that Connecticut
or Rhode-Island is better governed, or enjoys a greater share of rational
liberty, than South-Carolina, (or any of the other states having biennial
elections;) or, that either the one or the other of these states is
distinguished, in these respects, and by those causes, from the states,
whose elections are different from both.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 596.
 </b>
 These remarks are sufficient to establish the futility
of the maxim
alluded to, respecting the value of annual elections. The question, how
frequent elections should be, and what should be the term of service of
representatives, cannot be answered in any universal form, applicable to
all times, and all nations.
 <sup>
  <a href="#63">
   63
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is very complex in its nature, and must
ultimately resolve itself into a question of policy and sound, discretion,
with reference to the particular condition and circumstances of each
nation, to which it is sought to be applied. The same fundamental
principles of government may require very different, if not entirely
opposite practices in different states. There is great wis-
</p>
<p>
 dom in the observations of one of our eminent statesmen on this subject.
"It is apparent," said he, "that a delegation for a very short period, as
for a single day, would defeat the design of representation. The election
in that case would not seem to the people to be of any importance, and the
person elected would think as lightly of his appointment. The other extreme
is equally to be avoided. An election for a long term of years, or for
life, would remove the member too far from the control of the people, would
be dangerous to liberty, and in fact repugnant to the purposes of the
delegation. The truth, as usual, is placed somewhere between the extremes,
and, I believe, is included in this proposition; the term of election must
be so long, that the representative may understand the interests of the
people; and yet so limited, that his fidelity may be secured by a
dependence upon their approbation."
 <sup>
  <a href="#64">
   64
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 597.
 </b>
 The question, then, which was presented to the
consideration of the
convention, was, what duration of office, on the part of the members of the
house of representative, was, with reference to the structure of the other
branches of the legislative department of the general government, best
adapted to preserve the public liberty and to promote the general welfare.
I say, with reference to the structure of the other branches of the
legislative department of the general government, because it is obvious,
that the duration of office of the president and senate, and the nature and
extent of the powers to be confided to congress, must most materially
affect the decision upon this point. Absolute unanimity upon such a subject
could hardly be expected; and accordingly it will be found, that no
</p>
<p>
 inconsiderable diversity of opinion was exhibited in the discussions in the
convention. It was, in the first instance, decided in a committee of the
whole, that the period should be three years, seven states voting in the
affirmative, and four in the negative.
 <sup>
  <a href="#65">
   65
  </a>
 </sup>
 That period was afterwards struck
out by a vote of the convention, seven states voting in the affirmative,
three in the negative, and one being divided, and the word " two" was
unanimously inserted in its stead.
 <sup>
  <a href="#66">
   66
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the subsequent revision the clause
took the shape, in which it now stands in the constitution.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 598.
 </b>
 The reasons, which finally prevailed in the convention and
elsewhere in favour of biennial elections in preference to any other
period, may be arranged under the following heads:
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 599.
 </b>
 In the first place, an argument might properly be drawn
from the
extent of the country to be governed. The territorial extent of the United
States would require the representatives to travel from great distances,
and the arrangements, rendered necessary by that circumstance, would
furnish much more serious objections with men fit for this service, if
limited to a single year, than if extended to two years.
 <sup>
  <a href="#67">
   67
  </a>
 </sup>
 Annual
elections might be very well adapted to the state legislatures from the
facility of convening the members, and from the familiarity of the people
with all the general objects of local legislation, when they would be
highly inconvenient for the legislature of the Union. If, when convened,
the term of congress was of short duration, there would scarcely be time
properly to examine and mature
</p>
<p>
 measures. A new election might intervene before there had been an
opportunity to interchange opinions and acquire the information
indispensable for wise and salutary action.
 <sup>
  <a href="#68">
   68
  </a>
 </sup>
 Much of the business of the
national legislature must necessarily be postponed beyond a single session;
and if new men are to come every year, a great part of the information
already accumulated will be lost, or be unavoidably open for re-examination
before any vote can be properly had.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 600.
 </b>
 In the next place, however well founded the maxim might
be, that
where no other circumstances affect the case, the greater the power is, the
shorter ought to be its duration; and conversely, the smaller the power,
the more safely its duration may be protracted;
 <sup>
  <a href="#69">
   69
  </a>
 </sup>
 that maxim, if it applied
at all to the government of the Union, was favourable to the extension of
the period of service beyond that of the state legislatures. The powers of
congress are few and limited, and of a national character; those of the
state legislatures are general, and have few positive limitations. If
annual elections are safe for a state; biennial elections would not be less
safe for the United States. No just objection, then, could arise from this
source, upon any notion, that there would be a more perfect security for
public liberty in annual than in biennial elections.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 601.
 </b>
 But a far more important consideration grows out of the
nature and
objects of the powers of congress. The aim of every political constitution
is, or ought to be, first, to obtain for rulers men, who possess most
wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of society;
and, in the next place, to take the most effectual precautions for keeping,
them virtu-
</p>
<p>
 ous, whilst they continue to hold their public trust. Frequent elections
have, without question, a tendency to accomplish the latter object. But too
great a frequency will, almost invariably, defeat the former object, and,
in most cases, put at hazard the latter. As has been already intimated, it
has a tendency to introduce faction, and rash counsels, and passionate
appeals to the prejudices, rather than to the sober judgment of the people.
And we need not to be reminded, that faction and enthusiasm are the
instruments, by which popular governments are destroyed.
 <sup>
  <a href="#70">
   70
  </a>
 </sup>
 It operates
also, as a great discouragement upon suitable candidates offering
themselves for the public service. They can have little opportunity to
establish a solid reputation, as statesmen or patriot, when their schemes
are liable to be suddenly broken in upon by demagogues, who may create
injurious suspicions, and even displace them from office, before their
measures are fairly tried.
 <sup>
  <a href="#71">
   71
  </a>
 </sup>
 And they are apt to grow weary of continued
appeals to vindicate their character and conduct at the polls, since
success, however triumphant, is of such short duration, and confidence is
so easily loosened. These considerations, which are always of some weight,
are especially applicable to services in a national legislature, at a
distance from the constituents, and in cases, where a great variety of
information, not easily accessible, is indispensable to a right
understanding of the conduct and votes of representatives.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 602.
 </b>
 But the very nature and objects of the national
government require far more experience and knowledge, than what may be
thought requisite in the
</p>
<p>
 members of a state legislature. For the latter a knowledge of local
interests and opinions may ordinarily suffice. But it is far different with
a member of congress. He is to legislate for the interest and welfare, not
of one state only, but of all the states. It is not enough, that he comes
to the task with an upright intention and sound judgment, but he must have
a competent degree of knowledge of all the subjects, on which he is called
to legislate; and he must have skill, as to the best mode of applying it.
The latter can scarcely be acquired, but by long experience and training in
the national councils. The period of service ought, therefore, to bear some
proportion to the variety of knowledge and practical skill, which the
duties of the station demand.
 <sup>
  <a href="#72">
   72
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 603.
 </b>
 The most superficial glance at the relative duties of a
member of a
state legislature and of those of a member of congress, will put this
matter in a striking light. In a single state, the habits, manners,
institutions, and laws, are uniform, and all the citizens are more or less
conversant with them. The relative bearings of the various pursuits and
occupations of the people are well understood, or easily ascertained. The
general affairs of the state lie in a comparatively narrow compass, and are
daily discussed and examined by those, who have an immediate interest in
them, and by frequent communication with each other can interchange
opinions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#73">
   73
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is very different with the general government. There, every
measure is to be discussed with reference to the rights, interests, and
pursuits of all the states. When the constitution was adopted, there were
thirteen, and there are now twenty-four
</p>
<p>
 states, having different laws, institutions, employments, products, and
climates, and many artificial, as well as natural differences in the
structure of society, growing out of these circumstances. Some of them are
almost wholly agricultural; some commercial; some manufacturing; some have
a mixture of all; and in no two of them are there precisely the same
relative adjustments of all these interests. No legislation for the Union
can be safe or wise, which is not founded upon an accurate knowledge of
these diversities, and their practical influence upon public measures. What
may be beneficial and politic, with reference to the interests of a single
state, may be subversive of those of other states. A regulation of
commerce, wise and just for the commercial states, may strike at the
foundation of the prosperity of the agricultural or manufacturing states.
And, on the other hand, a measure beneficial to agriculture or
manufactures, may disturb, and even overwhelm the shipping interest. Large
and enlightened views, comprehensive information, and a just attention to
the local peculiarities, and products, and employments of different states,
are absolutely indispensable qualifications for a member of congress. Yet
it is obvious, that if very short periods of service are to be allowed to
members of congress, the continual fluctuations in the public councils, and
the perpetual changes of members will be very unfavourable to the
acquirement of the proper knowledge, and the due application of it for the
public welfare. One set of men will just have mastered the necessary
information, when they will be succeeded by a second set, who are to go
over the same grounds, and then are to be succeeded by a third. So, that
inexperience, instead of practical wisdom, hasty legislation, instead of
sober deliberation, and imperfect projects,
</p>
<p>
 instead of well constructed systems, would characterize the national
government.

  § 604.

 Congress has power to regulate commerce with foreign
nations and
among, the several states. How can foreign trade be properly regulated by
uniform laws without (I do not say some acquaintance, but) a large
acquaintance with the commerce, ports, usages, and regulations of foreign
states, and with the pursuits and products of the United States?  How can
trade between the different states be duly regulated, without an accurate
knowledge of their relative situation, and climate, and productions, and
facilities of intercourse.
 <sup>
  <a href="#75">

 </sup>
 Congress has power to lay taxes and imposts;
but how can taxes be judiciously imposed, and effectively collected, unless
they are accommodated to the local circumstances of the several states? The
power of taxation, even with the purest and best intentions, might, without
a thorough knowledge of the diversified interests of the states, become a
most oppressive and ruinous engine of power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#76">

 It is true, that
difficulties of this sort, will occur more frequently in the first
operations of the government, than afterwards.
 <sup>
  <a href="#77">

 </sup>
 But in a growing
community, like that of the United States, whose population has already
increased from three to thirteen millions within forty years, there must be
a perpetual change of measures to suit the new exigencies of agriculture,
commerce, and manufactures, and to ensure the vital objects of the
constitution. And, so far is it from being true, that the national
government has by its familiarity become more simple and facile in its
machinery and operations, that it may be affirmed, that a
</p>
<p>
 far more exact and comprehensive knowledge is now necessary to preserve its
adjustments, and to carry on its daily operations, than was required, or
even dreamed of, at its first institution. Its very success, as a plan of
government, has contributed, in no small degree, to give complexity to its
legislation. And the important changes in the world during its existence
has required very many developments of its powers and duties, which could
hardly have occurred, as practical truths to its enlightened founders.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 605.
 </b>
 There are other powers belonging to the national
government, which
require qualifications of a high character. They regard our foreign
intercourse and diplomatic policy. Although the house of representatives
does not directly participate in foreign negotiations and arrangements;
yet, from the necessary connexion between the several branches of public
affairs, its cooperation with the other departments of the government will
be often indispensable to carry them into full effect. Treaties with
foreign nations will often require the sanction of laws, not merely by way
of appropriations of money to comply with their stipulations; but also to
provide suitable regulations to give them a practical operation. Thus, a
purchase of territory, like that of Louisiana, would not only require the
house of representatives to vote an appropriation of money; and a treaty,
containing clauses of indemnity, like the British treaty of 1794, in like
manner require an appropriation to give it effect; but commercial treaties,
in an especial manner would require many variations and additions to the
existing laws in order to adjust them to the general system, and produce,
where it is intended, a just reciprocity.
 <sup>
  <a href="#78">
   78
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is hardly necessary to say,
that a com-
</p>
<p>
 petent knowledge of the law of nations is indispensable to every statesman;
and, that ignorance may not only involve the nation in embarrassing
controversies with other nations; but may also involve it in humiliating
sacrifices. Congress alone is entrusted with the power to declare war. What
would be said of representatives called upon to exercise this ultimate
appeal of sovereignty, who were ignorant of the just rights and duties of
belligerent and neutral nations?
 <sup>
  <a href="#79">
   79

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 606.
 </b>
 Besides; the whole diplomacy of the executive
department, and all
those relations with independent powers, which connect themselves with
foreign intercourse, are so intimately blended with the proper discharge of
legislative duties, that it is impossible, that they should not be
constantly brought under review in the public debates. They must frequently
furnish matter for censure or praise; for accusation or vindication; for
legislative checks, or legislative aids; for powerful appeals to popular
favour, or popular resentment; for the ardent contests of party; and even
for the graver exercise of the power of impeachment.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 607.
 </b>
 And this leads us naturally to another remark; and that
is, that a
due exercise of some of the powers confided to the house of
representatives, even in its most narrow functions, require, that the
members should at least be elected for a period of two years. The power of
impeachment could scarcely be exerted with effect by any body, which had
not a legislative life of such a period. It would scarcely be possible, in
ordinary cases, to begin and end an impeachment at a single annual session.
And the effect of change of members during its prosecution would be
attended with no inconsiderable embarrassment and inconvenience. If the
power
</p>
<p>
 is ever to be exerted, so as to bring great offenders to justice, there
must be a prolonged legislative term of office, so as to meet the exigency.
One year will not suffice to detect guilt, and to pursue it to conviction.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 608.
 </b>
 Again; the house of representatives is to be the sole
judge of the
elections of its own members. Now, if but one legislative session is to be
held in a year, and more than one cannot ordinarily be presumed convenient
or proper, spurious elections cannot be investigated and annulled in time
to have a due effect The sitting member must either hold his seat during
the whole period of the investigation, or he must be suspended during the
same period. In either case the public mischief will be very great. The
uniform practice has been to allow the member, who is returned, to hold his
seat and vote, until he is displaced by the order of the house, after full
investigation. If, then, a return can be obtained, no matter by what means,
the irregular member is sure of holding his seat, until a long period has
elapsed, (for that is indispensable to any thorough investigation of facts
arising at great distances;) and thus a very pernicious encouragement is
given to the use of unlawful means for obtaining irregular returns, and
fraudulent elections.
 <sup>
  <a href="#81">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 609.
 </b>
 There is one other consideration, not without its
weight in all
questions of this nature. Where elections are very frequent, a few of the
members, as happens in all such assembles, will possess superior talents;
will, by frequent re-elections, become members of long standing; will
become thoroughly masters of the public business; and thus will acquire a
preponderating and undue influence, of which they will naturally be dis-
</p>
<p>
 posed to avail themselves. The great bulk of the house will be composed of
new members, who will necessarily be inexperienced, diffident, and
undisciplined, and thus be subjected to the superior ability and
information of the veteran legislators. If biennial elections would have no
more cogent effect, than to diminish the amount of this inequality; to
guard unsuspecting confidence against the snares, which may be set for it;
and to stimulate a watchful and ambitious responsibility, it would have a
decisive advantage over mere annual elections.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 610.
 </b>
 Such were some of the reasons, which produced, on the
part of the
framers of the constitution, and ultimately of the people themselves, an
approbation of biennial elections. Experiencehas demonstrated the sound
policy and wisdom of the provision. But looking back to the period, when
the constitution was upon its passage, one cannot but be struck with the
alarms, with which the public mind was on this subject attempted to be
disturbed. It was repeatedly urged in and out of the state conventions,
that biennial elections were dangerous to the public liberty; and that
congress might perpetuate itself, and reign with absolute power over the
nation.

 <b>
  § 611.
 </b>
 In the next place, as to the qualifications of the
elected. The
constitution on this subject is as follows:3  "No person shall be a
representative, who "shall not have attained to the age of twenty-five
years, and been seven years a citizen of the United States;
</p>
<p>
 "and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state, in which
he shall be chosen."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 612.
 </b>
 It is obvious, that the inquiry, as to the due
qualifications of
representatives, like that, as to the due qualifications of electors in a
government, is susceptible, in its own nature, of very different answers,
according to the habits, institutions, interests, and local peculiarities
of different nations. It is a point, upon which we can arrive at no
universal rule, which will accommodate itself to the welfare and wants of
every people, with the same proportionate advantages. The great objects
are, or ought to be, to secure, on the part of the representatives,
fidelity, sound judgment, competent information, and incorruptible
independence. The best modes, by which these objects can be attained, are
matters of discussion and reasoning, and essentially dependent upon a large
and enlightened survey of the human character and passions, as developed in
the different stages of civilized society. There is great room, therefore,
for diversities of judgment and opinion upon a subject so comprehensive and
variable in its elements. It would be matter of surprise, if doctrines
essentially different, nay, even opposite to each other, should not, under
such circumstances, be maintained by political writers, equally eminent and
able. Upon questions of civil policy, and the fundamental structure of
governments, there has hitherto been too little harmony of opinion among
the greatest men to encourage any hope, that the future will be less
fruitful in dissonances, than the past. In the practice of governments, a
very great diversity of qualifications has been insisted on, as
prerequisites of office; and this alone would demonstrate, that there was
not admitted to exist any common stan-
</p>
<p>
 dard of superior excellence, adapted to all ages, and all nations.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 613.
 </b>
 In Great-Britain, besides those negative
qualifications, which are
founded in usage, or positive law, such as the exclusion of persons holding
certain offices and pensions, it is required, that every member for a
county, or knight of a shire, (as he is technically called,) shall have a
clear estate of freehold, or copyhold, to the value of 600 sterling per
annum; and every member for a city or borough, to the value of 300, except
the eldest sons of peers, and of persons qualified to be knights of shires,
and except the members of the two universities.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 614.
 </b>
 Among the American colonies antecedent to the
revolution, a great
diversity of qualifications existed; and the state constitutions,
subsequently formed, by no means lessen that diversity. Some insist upon a
freehold, or other property, of a certain value; others require a certain
period of residence, and citizenship only; others require a freehold only;
others a payment of taxes, or an equivalent; others, again, mix up all the
various qualifications of property, residence, citizenship, and taxation,
or substitute some of these, as equivalents for others.
 <sup>
  <a href="#86">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 615.
 </b>
 The existing qualifications in the states being then so
various, it
may be thought, that the best course would have been, to adopt the rules of
the states respectively, in regard to the most numerous branch of their own
legislatures. And this course might not have been open to serious
objections. But, as the qualifications of members were thought to be less
carefully defined in the state constitutions, and more susceptible of
</p>
<p>
 uniformity, than those of the electors, the subject was thought proper for
regulation by the convention.
 <sup>
  <a href="#87">
   87
  </a>
 </sup>
 And it is observable, that the positive
qualifications are few and simple. They respect only age, citizenship, and
inhabitancy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#88">
   88
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 616.
 </b>
 First, in regard to age. The representative must have
attained
twenty-five years. And certainly to this no reasonable objection can be
made.
 <sup>
  <a href="#89">
   89
  </a>
 </sup>
 If experience, or wisdom, or knowledge be of value in the national
councils, it can scarcely be pretended, that an earlier age could afford a
certain guaranty for either. That some qualification of age is proper, no
one will dispute. No one will contend, that persons, who are minors, ought
to be eligible; or, that those, who have not attained manhood, so as to be
entitled by the common law to dispose of their persons, or estates, at
their own will, would be fit depositaries of the authority to dispose of
the rights, persons, and property of others. Would the mere attainment of
twenty-one years of age be a more proper qualification? All just reasoning
would be against it. The characters and passions of young men can scarcely
be understood at the moment of their majority. They are then new to the
rights of self-government; warm in their passions; ardent in their
expectations; and, just escaping from pupilage, are strongly tempted to
discard the lessons of caution, which riper years inculcate. What they will
become, remains to be seen; and four years beyond that period is but a very
short space, in which to try their virtues, develope their talents, enlarge
their resources, and give them a practical insight into the business of
life ade-
</p>
<p>
 quate to their own immediate wants and duties. Can the interests of others
be safely confided to those, who have yet to learn how to take care of
their own? The British constitution has, indeed, provided only for the
members of the house of commons not being minors;
 <sup>
  <a href="#90">
   90
  </a>
 </sup>
 and illustrious
instances have occurred to show, that great statesmen may be formed even
during their minority. But such instances are rare, they are to be looked
at as prodigies, rather than as examples; as the extraordinary growth of a
peculiar education and character, and a hot-bed precocity in a monarchy,
rather than as the sound and thrifty growth of the open air, and the
bracing hardihood of a republic. In the convention this qualification, as
to age, did not pass without a struggle. It was originally carried by a
vote of seven states against three, one being divided; though it was
ultimately adopted without a division.
 <sup>
  <a href="#91">
   91
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the state conventions it does
not seem to have formed any important topic of debate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#92">
   92
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 617.
 </b>
 Secondly, in regard to citizenship. It is required, that the
representative shall have been a citizen of the United States seven years.
Upon the propriety of excluding aliens from eligibility, there could
scarcely be any room for debate; for there could be no security for a due
administration of any government by persons, whose interests and connexions
were foreign, and who owed no permanent allegiance to it, and had no
permanent stake in its measures or operations. Foreign influence, of the
most corrupt and mischievous nature, could not fail to make its way into
the public councils, if there was no guard against the introduction of
alien representatives.
 <sup>
  <a href="#93">
   93
  </a>
 </sup>
 It has accordingly been a fundamental policy of
most, if not of all free states, to exclude all foreigners from holding
offices in the state. The only practical question would seem to be, whether
foreigners, even after naturalization, should be eligible as
representatives; and if so, what was a suitable period of citizenship for
the allowance of the privilege. In England, all aliens born, unless
naturalized, were originally excluded from a seat in parliament; and now,
by positive legislation, no alien, though naturalized, is capable of being
a member of either house of parliament.
 <sup>
  <a href="#94">
   94
  </a>
 </sup>
 A different course, naturally
arising from the circumstances of the country, was adopted in the American
colonies antecedent to the revolution, with a view to invite emigrations,
and settlements, and thus to facilitate the cultivation of their wild and
waste lands. A similar policy had since pervaded the state governments, and
had been attended with so many advantages, that it would hare been
</p>
<p>
 impracticable to enforce any total exclusion of naturalized citizens from
office. In the convention it was originally proposed, that three years'
citizenship should constitute a qualification; but that was exchanged for
seven years by a vote of ten states to one.
 <sup>
  <a href="#95">
   95
  </a>
 </sup>
 No objection seems even to
have been suggested against this qualification; and hitherto it has
obtained a general acquiescence or approbation. It certainly subserves two
important purposes. 1. That the constituents have a full opportunity of
knowing the character and merits of their representative. 2. That the
representative has a like opportunity of learning the character, and wants,
and opinions of his constituents.
 <sup>
  <a href="#96">
   96
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 618.
 </b>
 Thirdly, in regard to inhabitancy. It is required, that the
representative shall, when elected, be an inhabitant of the state, in which
he shall be chosen. The object of this clause, doubtless, was to secure an
attachment to, and a just representation of, the interests of the state in
the national councils. It was supposed, that an inhabitant would feel a
deeper concern, and possess a more enlightened view of the various
interests of his constituents, than a mere stranger. And, at all events, he
would generally possess more entirely their sympathy and confidence. It is
observable, that the inhabitancy required is within the state, and not
within any particular district of the state, in which the member is chosen.
In England, in former times, it was required, that all the members of the
house of commons should be inhabitants of the places, for which they were
chosen. But this was for a long time wholly disregarded in practice, and
was at length repealed by
</p>
<p>
 statute of 14 Geo. 3, ch. 58.
 <sup>
  <a href="#97">
   97
  </a>
 </sup>
 This circumstance is not a little
remarkable in parliamentary history; and it establishes, in a very striking
manner, how little mere theory can be regarded in matters of government. It
was found by experience, that boroughs and cities were often better
represented by men of eminence, and known patriotism, who were strangers to
them, than by those chosen from their own vicinage. And to this very hour
some of the proudest names in English History, as patriots and statesmen,
have been the representatives of obscure, and, if one may so say, of
ignoble boroughs.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 619.
 </b>
 An attempt was made in the convention to introduce a
qualification
of one year's residence before the election; but it failed, four states
voting in favour of it, six against it, and one being divided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#98">
   98
  </a>
 </sup>
 The
omission to provide, that a subsequent non-residence shall be a vacation of
the seat, may in some measure defeat the policy of the original limitation.
For it has happened, in more than one instance, that a member, after his
election, has removed to another state, and thus ceased to have that
intimate intercourse with, and dependence upon his constituents, upon which
so much value has been placed in all his discussions on this subject.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 620.
 </b>
 It is observable, that no qualification, in point of
estate, has
been required on the part of members of the house of representatives.
 <sup>
  <a href="#99">
   99
  </a>
 </sup>
 Yet such a qualification is insisted on, by a considerable number of the
states, as a qualification for the popular branch of the
</p>
<p>
 state legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#100">
   100
  </a>
 </sup>
 The probability is, that it was not incorporated into
the constitution of the Union from the difficulty of framing a provision,
that would be generally acceptable. Two reasons have, however, been
assigned by a learned commentator for the omission, which deserve notice.
First, that in a representative government the people have an undoubted
right to judge for themselves of the qualification of their representative,
and of their opinion if his integrity and ability will supply the want of
estate, there is better reason for contending, that it ought not prevail.
Secondly, that by requiring a property qualification, it may happen, that
men, the best qualified in other respects, might be incapacitated from
serving their country.
 <sup>
  <a href="#101">
   101
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is, doubtless, weight in each of these
considerations. The first, however, is equally applicable to all sorts of
qualifications whatsoever; and proceeds upon art inadmissible foundation;
and that is, that the society has no just right to regulate for the common
good, what a portion of the community may deem for their special good. The
other reason has a better foundation in theory; though, generally speaking,
it will rarely occur in practice. But it goes very far towards overturning
another fundamental guard, which is deemed essential to public liberty; and
that is, that the representative should have a common interest in measures
with his constituents. Now, the power of taxation, one of the most delicate
and important in human society, will rarely be exerted oppressively by
those, who are to share the common burthens. The possession of property has
in this respect a great value
</p>
<p>
 among the proper qualifications of a representative; since it will have a
tendency to check any undue impositions, or sacrifices, which may equally
injure his own, as well as theirs.
 <sup>
  <a href="#102">
   102
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 621.
 </b>
 In like manner there is a total absence of any qualification
founded on religious opinions. However desirable it may be, that every
government should be administered by those, who have a fixed religious
belief, and feel a deep responsibility to an infinitely wise and eternal
Being; and however strong may be our persuasion of the everlasting value of
a belief in Christianity for our present, as well as our immortal welfare;
the history of the world has shown the extreme dangers, as well as
difficulties, of connecting the civil power with religious opinions. Half
the calamities, with which the human race have been scourged, have arisen
from the union of church and state; and the people of America, above all
others, have too largely partaken of the terrors and the sufferings of
persecution for conscience' sake, not to feel an excessive repugnance to
the introduction of religious tests. Experience has demonstrated the folly,
as well as the injustice, of exclusions from office, founded upon religious
opinions. They have aggravated all other evils in the political
organization of societies. They carry in their train discord, oppression,
and bloodshed.
 <sup>
  <a href="#103">
   103
  </a>
 </sup>
 They perpetuate a savage ferocity, and insensibility to
human rights and sufferings. Wherever they have been abolished, they have
introduced peace and moderation, and enlightened legislation. Wherever they
have been perpetuated, they have always checked, and in many
</p>
<p>
 cases have overturned all the securities of public liberty. The right to
burn heretics survived in England almost to the close of the reign of
Charles the Second;
 <sup>
  <a href="#104">
   104
  </a>
 </sup>
 and it has been asserted, (but I have not been able
to ascertain the fact by examination of the printed journals,) that on that
occasion the whole bench of bishops voted against the repeal. We all know
how slowly the Roman Catholics have recovered their just rights in England
and Ireland. The triumph has been but just achieved, after a most painful
contest for a half century. In the catholic countries, to this very hour,
protestants are, for the most part, treated with a cold and reluctant
jealousy, tolerated perhaps, but never cherished. In the actual situation
of the United States a union of the states would have been impractible from
the known diversity of religious sects, if any thing more, than a simple
belief in Christianity in the most general form of expression, had been
required. And even to this some of the states would have objected, as
inconsistent with the fundamental policy of their own charters,
constitutions, and laws. Whatever, indeed, may have been the desire of many
persons, of a deep religious reeling, to have embodied some provision on
this subject in the constitution, it may be safely affirmed, that hitherto
the absence has not been felt, as an evil; and that while Christianity
continues to be the belief of the enlightened, and wise, and pure, among
the electors, it is impossible, that infidelity can find an easy home in
the house of representatives.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 622.
 </b>
 It has been justly observed, that under the reasonable
qualifications established by the constitution, the door of this part of
the federal government is open

<p>
 to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or
old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or any particular profession
of religious faith.1
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 623.
 </b>
 A question, however, has been suggested upon this
subject, which
ought not to be passed over without notice. And that is, whether the states
can superadd any qualifications to those prescribed by the constitution of
the United States. The laws of some of the states have already required,
that the representative should be a freeholder, and be resident within the
district, for which he is chosen.
 <sup>
  <a href="#105">
   105
  </a>
 </sup>
 If a state legislature has authority to
pass laws to this effect, they may impose any other qualifications beyond
those provided by the constitution, however inconvenient, restrictive, or
even mischievous they may be to the interests of the Union. The legislature
of one state may require, that none but a Deist, a Catholic, a Protestant,
a Calvinist, or a Universalist, shall be a representative. The legislature
of another state may require, that none shall be a representative but a
planter, a farmer, a mechanic, or a manufacturer. It may exclude merchants,
and divines, and physicians, and lawyers. Another legislature may require a
high monied qualification, a freehold of great value, or personal estate of
great amount. Another legislature may require, that the party shall have
been born, and always lived in the state, or district; or that he shall be
an inhabitant of a particular town or city, free of a corporation, or
eldest son. In short, there is no end to the varieties of qualifications,
which, without insisting upon extravagant cases, may be imagined. A state
may, with the
</p>
<p>
 sole object of dissolving the Union, create qualifications so high, and so
singular, that it shall become impracticable to elect any representative.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 624.
 </b>
 It would seem but fair reasoning upon the plainest
principles of
interpretation, that when the constitution established certain
qualifications, as necessary for office, it meant to exclude all others, as
prerequisites. From the very nature of such a provision, the affirmation of
these qualifications would seem to imply a negative of all others. And a
doubt of this sort seems to have pervaded the mind of a learned
commentator.
 <sup>
  <a href="#106">
   106

 </sup>
 A power to add new qualifications is certainly equivalent
to a power to very them. It adds to the aggregate, what changes the nature
of the former requisites. The house of representatives seems to have acted
upon this interpretation, and to have held, that the state legislatures
have no power to prescribe new qualifications, unknown to the constitution
of the United States.

 however, with
his avowed devotion to state power, has intimated a contrary doctrine.
"If," says he, "whenever the constitution assumes a single power out of
many, which belong to the same subject, we should consider it as assuming
the whole, it would vest the general government with a mass of powers never
contemplated. On the contrary, the assumption of particular powers seems an
exclusion of all not assumed. This reasoning appears to me to be sound, but
on so recent a change of view, caution requires us not to be over
confident."

  § 625.
 </b>
 It does not seem to have occurred to this celebrated
statesman,
that the whole of this reasoning, which is avowedly founded upon that
amendment to the constitution, which provides, that "the powers not
delegated nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states
respectively, or to the people," proceeds upon a basis, which is
inapplicable to the case. In the first place, no powers could be reserved
to the states, except those, which existed in the states before the
constitution was adopted. The amendment does not profess, and, indeed, did
not intend to confer on the states any new powers; but merely to reserve to
them, what were not conceded to the government of the Union. Now, it may
properly be asked, where did the states get the power to appoint
representatives in the national government? Was it a power, that existed at
all before the constitution was adopted? If derived from the constitution,
must it not be derived exactly under the qualifications established by the
constitution, and none others? If the constitution has delegated no power
to the states to add new qualifications, how can they claim any such power
by the mere adoption of that instrument, which they did not before possess?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 626.
 </b>
 The truth is, that the states can exercise no powers
whatsoever,
which exclusively spring out of the existence of the national government,
which the constitution does not delegate to them. They have just as much
right, and no more, to prescribe new qualifications for a representative,
as they have for a president. Each is an officer of the Union, deriving his
</p>
<p>
 powers and qualifications from the constitution, and neither created by,
dependent upon, nor controllable by, the states. It is no original
prerogative of state power to appoint a representative, a senator, or
president for the Union. Those officers owe their existence and functions
to the united voice of the whole, not of a portion, of the people. Before a
state can assert the right, it must show, that the constitution has
delegated and recognised it. No state can say, that it has reserved, what
it never possessed.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 627.
 </b>
 Besides; independent of this, there is another fundamental
objection to the reasoning. The whole scope of the argument is, to show,
that the legislature of the state has a right to prescribe new
qualifications. Now, if the state in its political capacity had it, it
would not follow, that the legislature possessed it. That must depend upon
the powers confided to the state legislature by its own constitution. A
state, and the legislature of a state, are quite different political
beings. Now it would be very desirable to know, in which part of any state
constitution this authority, exclusively of a national character, is found
delegated to any state legislature. But this is not all. The amendment does
not reserve the powers to the states exclusively, as political bodies; for
the language of the amendment is, that the powers not delegated, &amp;c. are
reserved to the states, or to the people. To justify, then, the exercise of
the power by a state, it is indispensable to show, that it has not been
reserved to the people of the state. The people of the state, by adopting
the constitution, have declared what their will is, as to the
qualifications for office. And here the maxim, if ever, must apply,
Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. It might further be urged, that the
constitution, being the act of the whole
</p>
<p>
 people of the United States, formed and fashioned according to their own
views, it is not to be assumed, as the basis of any reasoning, that they
have given any control over the functionaries created by it, to any state,
beyond what is found in the text of the instrument. When such a control is
asserted, it is matter of roof, not of assumption; it is matter to be
established, as of right, and not to be exercised by usurpation, until it
is displaced. The burthen of proof is on the state, and not on the
government of the Union. The affirmative is to be established; the negative
is not to be denied, and the denial taken for a concession.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 628.
 </b>
 In regard to the power of a state to prescribe the
qualification of
inhabitancy or residence in a district, as an additional qualification,
there is this forcible reason for denying it, that it is undertaking to act
upon the very qualification prescribed by the constitution, as to
inhabitancy in the state, and abridging its operation. It is precisely the
same exercise of power on the part of the states, as if they should
prescribe, that a representative should be forty years of age, and a
citizen for ten years. In each case, the very qualification fixed by the
constitution is completely evaded, and indirectly abolished.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 629.
 </b>
 The next clause of the second section of the first
article respects
the apportionment of the representatives among the states. It is as
follows: "Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the
several states, which may be included in this Union, according to their
respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number
of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and
excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons. The actual
enumeration
</p>
<p>
 shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the congress of
the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such
manner, as they shall, by law, direct. The number of representatives shall
not exceed one for every thirty thousand; but each state shall have at
least one representative. And until such enumeration shall be made, the
state of New-Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three, Massachusetts
eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five,
New-York six, NewJersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland
six, Virginia ten, North-Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia
three."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 630.
 </b>
 The first apportionment thus made, being of a temporary and
fugacious character, requires no commentary.
 <sup>
  <a href="#111">
   111
  </a>
 </sup>
 The basis assumedwas
probably very nearly the same, which the constitution pointed out for all
future apportionments, or, at least, of all the free persons in the
states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#112">
   112
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 It is obvious, that the question, how: the apportionment should be made,
was one, upon which a considerable diversity of judgment might, and
probably would, exist. Three leading principles of apportionment would, at
once, present themselves. One was to adopt the rule already existing, under
the confederation; that is, an equality of representation and vote by each
state, thus giving each state a right to send not less than two, nor more
than seven representatives, and in the determination of questions, each
state to have one vote.
 <sup>
  <a href="#113">
   113
  </a>
 </sup>
 This would naturally receive encouragement from
all those, who were attached to the confederation, and preferred
</p>
<p>
 a mere league of states, to a government in any degree national.
 <sup>
  <a href="#114">
   114
  </a>
 </sup>
 And
accordingly it formed, as it should seem, the basis of what was called the
New-Jersey Plan.
 <sup>
  <a href="#115">
   115
  </a>
 </sup>
 This rule of apportionment met, however, with a decided
opposition, and was negatived in the convention at an early period, seven
states voting against it, three being in its favour, and one being
divided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#116">
   116
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 631.
 </b>
 Another principle might be, to apportion the
representation of the
states according to the relative property of each, thus making property the
basis of representation. This might commend itself to some persons, because
it would introduce a salutary check into the legislature in regard to
taxation, by securing, in some measure, an equalization of the public
burthens, by the voice of those, who were called to give most towards the
common contributions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#117">
   117
  </a>
 </sup>
 That taxation ought to go hand in hand with
representation, bad been a favourite theory of the American people. Under
the confederation, all the common expenses were required to be borne by the
states in proportion to the value of the land within each state.
 <sup>
  <a href="#118">
   118
  </a>
 </sup>
 But it
has been already seen, that this mode of contribution was extremely
difficult and embarrassing, and unsatisfactory in practice, under the
confederation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#119">
   119
  </a>
 </sup>
 There do not, indeed,
</p>
<p>
 seem to be any traces in the proceedings of the convention, that this
scheme had an exclusive influence with any persons in that body. It mixed
itself up with other considerations, without acquiring any decisive
preponderance. In the first place, it was easy to provide a remedial check
upon undue direct taxation, the only species, of which there could be the
slightest danger of unequal and oppressive levies. And it will be seen,
that this was sufficiently provided for, by declaring, that representatives
and direct taxes should be apportioned by the same ratio.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 632.
 </b>
 In the next place, although property may not be
directly aimed at,
as a basis in the representation, provided for by the constitution, it
cannot, on the other hand, be deemed to be totally excluded, as will
presently be seen. In the next place, it is not admitted, that property
alone can, in a free government, safely be relied on, as the sole basis of
representation. It may be true, and probably is, that in the ordinary
course of affairs, it is not the interest, or policy of those, who possess
property, to oppress those, who want it. But, in every well ordered
commonwealth, persons, as well as property, should possess a just share of
influence. The liberties of the people are too dear, and too sacred to be
entrusted to any persons, who may not, at all times, have a common sympathy
and common interest with the people in the preservation of their public
rights, privileges, and liberties. Checks and balances, if not
indispensable to, are at least a great conservative in, the operations of
all free governments. And, perhaps, upon mere abstract theory, it cannot be
justly affirmed, that either persons or property, numbers or wealth, can
safely be trusted, as the final repositaries of the dele-
</p>
<p>
 gated powers of government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#120">
   120
  </a>
 </sup>
 By apportioning influence among each,
vigilance, caution, and mutual checks are naturally introduced, and
perpetuated.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 633.
 </b>
 The third and remaining principle was, to apportion the
representatives among the states according to their relative numbers. This
had the recommendation of great simplicity and uniformity in its operation,
of being generally acceptable to the people, and of being less liable to
fraud and evasion, than any other, which could be devised.
 <sup>
  <a href="#121">
   121
  </a>
 </sup>
 Besides;
although wealth and property cannot be affirmed to be in different states,
exactly in proportion to the numbers; they are not so widely separated from
it, as, at a hasty glance, might be imagined. There is, if not a natural,
at least a very common connexion between them; and, perhaps, an
apportionment of taxes according to numbers is as equitable a rule for
contributions according to relative wealth, as any, which can be
practically obtained.
 <sup>
  <a href="#122">
   122
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 634.
 </b>
 The scheme, therefore, under all the circumstances, of
making
numbers the basis of the representation of the Union, seems to have
obtained more general favour, than any other in the convention, because it
had a natural and universal connexion with the rights and liberties of the
whole people.
 <sup>
  <a href="#123">
   123
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 635.
 </b>
 But here a difficulty of a very serious nature arose.
There were
other persons in several of the states, than those, who were free. There
were some persons, who were bound to service for a term of years; though
these were so few, that they would scarcely
</p>
<p>
 vary the result of the general rule, in any important degree. There were
Indians, also, in several, and probably in most, of the states at that
period, who were not treated as citizens, and yet, who did not form a part
of independent communities or tribes, exercising general sovereignty and
powers of government within the boundaries of the states. It was necessary,
therefore, to provide for these cases, though they were attended with no
practical difficulty. There seems not to have been any objection in
including, in the ratio of representation, persons bound to service for a
term of years, and in excluding Indians not taxed. The real (and it was a
very exciting) controversy was in regard to slaves, whether they should be
included in the enumeration, or not.
 <sup>
  <a href="#124">
   124
  </a>
 </sup>
 On the one hand, it was contended,
that slaves were treated in the states, which tolerated slavery, as
property, and not as persons.
 <sup>
  <a href="#125">
   125
  </a>
 </sup>
 They were bought and sold, devised and
transferred, like any other property. They had no civil rights, or
political privileges. They had no will of their own; but were bound to
absolute obedience to their masters. There was, then, no more reason for
including them in the census of persons, than there would be for including
any brute animals whatsoever.
 <sup>
  <a href="#126">
   126
  </a>
 </sup>
 If they were to be represented as property,
the rule should be extended, so as to embrace all otherproperty. It would
be a gross inequality to allow representation for slaves to the southern
states; for that, in effect, would be, to allow to their masters a
predominant right, founded on mere property. Thus, five thousand free
persons, in a slave-state, might possess the same power
</p>
<p>
 to choose a representative, as thirty thousand free persons in a
non-slave-holding state.
 <sup>
  <a href="#127">
   127
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 636.
 </b>
 On the other hand, it was contended, that slaves are deemed
persons, as well as property. They partake of the qualities of both. In
being compelled to labour, not for himself, but for his master; in being
vendible by one master to another; and, in being subject, at all times, to
be restrained in his liberty, and chastised in his body, by the will of
another, the slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and
classed with the irrational animals, which fall under the denomination of
property. But, in being protected in his life and limbs against the
violence of others, even of the master of his labour and liberty; and in
being punishable himself for all violence committed against others; the
slave is no less evidently regarded by law, as a member of the society, and
not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral person, and not as a
mere article of property.
 <sup>
  <a href="#128">
   128
  </a>
 </sup>
 The federal constitution should, therefore,
view them in the mixed character of persons and property, which was in fact
their true character. It is true, that slaves are not included in the
estimate of representatives in any of the states possessing them. They
neither vote themselves, nor increase the vote of their masters. But it is
also true, that the constitution itself does not proceed upon any ratio of
merely qualified voters, either as to representatives, or as to electors of
them. If, therefore, those, who are not voters, are to be excluded from the
enumeration or census, a similar inequality will exist in the apportionment
among the states. For the representatives are to be chosen by those, who
are qualified vot-
</p>
<p>
 ers, for the most numerous branch of the state legislature; and the
qualifications in different states are essentially different; and, indeed,
are in no two states exactly alike. The constitution itself, therefore,
lays down a principle, which requires; that no regard shall be had to the
policy of particular states, towards their own inhabitants. Why should not
the same principle apply to slaves, as to other persons, who were excluded
as voters in the states?
 <sup>
  <a href="#129">
   129
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 637.
 </b>
 Some part of this reasoning may not be very
satisfactory; and
especially the latter part of it. The distinction between a free person,
who is not a voter, but who is, in no sense, property, and a slave, who is
not a voter, and who is, in every practical sense, property, is, and for
ever must form, a sound ground for discriminating between them in every
constitution of government.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 638.
 </b>
 It was added, that the idea was not entirely a just
one, that
representation relates to persons only, and not to property. Government is
instituted no less for the protection of the property, than of the persons
of individuals. The one, as well as the other, may, therefore, be
considered as proper to be represented by those, who are charged with the
government. And, in point of fact, this view of the subject constituted the
basis of some of the representative departments in several of the state
governments.
 <sup>
  <a href="#130">
   130
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 639.
 </b>
 There was another reason urged, why the votes allowed in the
federal legislature to the people of each state ought to bear some
proportion to the comparative wealth of the states. It was, that states
</p>
<p>
 have not an influence over other states, arising from the superior
advantages of fortune, and individuals in the same state possess over their
needy fellow citizens from the like cause. The richest state in the Union
can hardly indulge the hope of influencing the choice of a single
representative in any other state; nor will the representatives of the
largest and richest states possess any other advantages in the national
legislature, than what results from superior numbers alone.
 <sup>
  <a href="#131">
   131

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 640.
 </b>
 It is obvious, that these latter reasons have no just
application
to the subject. They are not only over-strained, and founded in an
ingenious attempt to gloss over the real objections; but they have this
inherent vice, that, if well rounded, they apply with equal force to the
representation of all property in all the states; and if not entitled to
respect on this account, they contain a most gross and indefensible
inequality in favour of a single species of property (slaves) existing in a
few states only. It might have been contended, with full as much propriety,
that rice, or cotton, or tobacco, or potatoes, should have been exclusively
taken into account in apportioning the representation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 641.
 </b>
 The truth is, that the arrangement adopted by the
constitution was
a matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its
operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which
was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of
interests, and physical condition, and political institutions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#132">
   132
  </a>
 </sup>
 It was
agreed, that slaves should be
</p>
<p>
 represented, under the mild appellation of "other persons," not as free
persons, but only in the proportion of three fifths. The clause was in
substance borrowed from the resolve, passed by the continental congress on
the 18th of April, 1783, recommending the states to amend the articles of
confederation in such manner, that the national expenses should be defrayed
out of a common treasury, "which shall be supplied by the several states,
in proportion to the whole number of white, or other free inhabitants, of
every age, sex, and condition, including those bound to servitude for a
term of years, and three fifths of all other persons, not comprehended in
the foregoing description, except Indians, not paying taxes, in each
state."
 <sup>
  <a href="#133">
   133
  </a>
 </sup>
 In order to reconcile the non-slave-holding states to this
provision, another clause was inserted, that direct taxes should be
apportioned in the same manner as representatives. So, that, theoretically,
representation and taxation might go pari passu.
 <sup>
  <a href="#134">
   134
  </a>
 </sup>
 This provision,
however, is more specious than solid; for while, in the levy of direct
taxes, it apportions them on three fifths of persons not free, it, on the
other hand, really exempts the other two fifths from being taxed at all, as
property.
 <sup>
  <a href="#135">
   135
  </a>
 </sup>
 Whereas, if direct taxes had been apportioned, as upon
principle they ought to be, according to the real value of property within
the state, the whole of the slaves would have been taxable, as property.
But a far more striking inequality has been disclosed by the practical
operations of the government. The principle of representation is
</p>
<p>
 constant, and uniform; the levy of direct taxes is occasional, and rare. In
the course of forty years, no more than three direct taxes1  have been
levied; and those only under very extraordinary and pressing circumstances.
The ordinary expenditures of the government are, and always have been,
derived from other sources. Imports upon foreign importations have
supplied, and will generally supply, all the common wants; and if these
should not furnish an adequate revenue, excises are next resorted to, as
the surest and most convenient mode of taxation. Direct taxes constitute
the last resort; and (as might have been foreseen) would never be laid,
until other resources had failed.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 642.
 </b>
 Viewed in its proper light, as a real compromise, in a
case of
conflicting interests, for the common good, the provision is entitled to
great praise for its moderation, its aim at practical utility, and its
tendency to satisfy the people, that the Union, framed by all, ought to be
dear to all, by the privileges it confers, as well as the blessings it
secures. It had a material influence in reconciling the southern states to
other provisions in the constitution, and especially to the power of making
commercial regulations by a mere majority, which was thought peculiarly to
favour the northern states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#137">
   137

 </sup>
 It has sometimes been complained of, as a
grievance; but he, who wishes well to his country, will adhere steadily to
it, as a fundamental policy, which extinguishes some of the most
mischievous sources of all political divisions, -- those founded on
geographical positions, and domestic institutions. It did not, however,
pass the convention without objec-
</p>
<p>
 tion. Upon its first introduction, it was supported by the votes of nine
states against two. In subsequent stages of the discussion, it met with
some opposition;
 <sup>
  <a href="#138">

 and in some of the state conventions it was strenuously
resisted.

 <b>
  § 643.
 </b>
 Another part of the clause regards the periods, at which the
enumeration or census of the inhabitants of the United States shall be
taken, in order to provide for new apportionments of representatives,
according to the relative increase of the population of the states. Various
propositions for this purpose were laid, at different times, before the
convention.
 <sup>
  <a href="#140">
   140
  </a>
 </sup>
 It was proposed to have the census taken once in fifteen
years, and in twenty years; but the vote finally prevailed in favour of
ten.
 <sup>
  <a href="#141">
   141
  </a>
 </sup>
 The importance of this provision for a decennial census can
scarcely be overvalued. It is the only effectual means, by which the
relative power of the several states could be justly represented. If the
system first established had been unalterable, very gross inequalities
would soon have taken place among the states, from the very unequal
increase of their population. The representation would soon have exhibited
a system very analogous to that of the house of commons in Great-Britain,
where old and decayed boroughs send representatives, not only wholly
disproportionate to their importance; but in some cases, with scarcely a
single inhabitant, they match the representatives of the most populous
counties.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 644.
 </b>
 In regard to the United States, the slightest examination
of the
apportionment made under the first three censuses will demonstrate this
conclusion in a very striking manner. The representation of Delaware
remains, as it was at thefirst apportionment; those of New-Hampshire,
Rhode-Island, Connecticut, NewJersey, and Maryland have had but a small
comparative increase; whilst that of Massachusetts (including Maine) has
swelled from eight to twenty; that of New-York, from six to thirty-four;
and that of Pennsylvania, from eight to twenty-six. In the mean time, the
new states have sprung into being; and Ohio, which in 1803 was only
entitled to one, now counts fourteen representatives.
 <sup>
  <a href="#143">
   143
  </a>
 </sup>
 The census of 1831
exhibits still more striking results. In 1790, the whole population of the
United States was about three millions nine hundred and twenty-nine
thousand; and in 1830, it was about twelve millions eight hundred and
fifty-six thousand.
 <sup>
  <a href="#144">
   144
  </a>
 </sup>
 Ohio, at this very moment, contains at least one
million, and New-York two millions of inhabitants. These facts show the
wisdom of the provision for a decennial apportionment; and, indeed, it
would otherwise have happened, that the system, however sound at the
beginning, would by this time have been productive of gross abuses, and
probably have engendered feuds and discontents, of themselves sufficient to
have occasioned a dissolution of the Union. We probably owe this provision
to those in the convention, who were in favour of a national government, in
preference to a mere confederation of states.

 The next part of the clause relates to the total number of the
house of representatives. It declares, that "the number of representatives
shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand." This was a subject of
great interest; and it has been asserted, that scarcely. any article of the

 Several objections were urged against the provision;
First, that so
small a number of representatives would be an unsafe depositary of the
public interests, Secondly, that they would not possess a proper knowledge
of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents. Thirdly, that
they would be taken from that class of citizens, which would sympathize
least with the feelings of the people, and be most likely to aim at a
permanent elevation of the few, on the depression of the many. Fourthly,
that defective, as the number in the first instance would be, it would be
more and more disproportionate by the increase of the population, and the
obstacles, which would prevent a correspondent increase of the
representatives.

aristocratical and exclusive power, which were so confidently predicted,
have all vanished into air, into thin air. Truth has silently dissolved the
phantoms raised by imaginations, heated by prejudice or controversy; and at
the distance of forty years we look back with astonishment at the laborious
reasoning, which was employed to tranquillize the doubts, and assuage the
jealousies of the people. It is fit, however, even now, to bring this
reasoning under review, because it inculcates upon us the important lesson,
how little reliance can be placed upon mere theory in any matters of
government; and how difficult it is to vindicate the most sound practical
doctrines against the specious questioning of ingenuity and hostility.

 The first objection was, to the smallness of the number
composing
the house of representatives.
 <sup>
  <a href="#148">

 It was said, that it was unsafe to deposit
the legislative powers of the Union with so small a body of men. It was but
the shadow of representation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#149">
   149
  </a>
 </sup>
 Under the confederation, congress might
consist of ninety-one; whereas, in the first instance, the house would
consist of but sixty-five. There was no certainty, that it would ever be
increased, as that would depend upon the legislature itself in its future
ratio of apportionments; and it was left completely in its discretion, not
only to
</p>
<p>
 increase, but to diminish the present number.
 <sup>
  <a href="#150">
   150

 Under such circumstances,
there was, in fact, no constitutional security, for the whole depended upon
the mere integrity and patriotism of those, who should be called to
administer it.

<p>
 <b>
  § 649.
 </b>
 In reply to these suggestions it was said, that the
present number
would certainly be adequate, until a census was taken. Although under the
confederation ninety-one members might be chosen, in point of fact a far
less number attended.
 <sup>
  <a href="#152">
   152
  </a>
 </sup>
 At the very first census, supposing the lowest
ratio of thirty thousand were adopted, the number of representatives would
be increased to one hundred. At the expiration of twentyfive years it
would, upon the same ratio, amount to two hundred; and in fifty years, to
four hundred, a number, which no one could doubt would be sufficiently
large to allay all the fears of the most zealous admirers of a full
representation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#153">
   153
  </a>
 </sup>
 In regard to the possible diminution of the number of
representatives, it must be surely an imaginary case. As every state is
entitled to at least one representative, the standard never would probably
be reduced below the population of the smallest state. The population of
Delaware, which increases more slowly, than that of any other state, would,
under such circumstances, furnish the rule. And, if the other states
increase to a very large degree, it is idle to suppose, that they will ever
adopt a ratio, which will give the smallest stale a greater relative power
and influence, than themselves.

  § 650.
 </b>
 But the question itself, what is the proper and convenient
number
to compose a representative legislature, is as little susceptible of a
precise solution, as any, which can be stated in the whole circle of
politics. There is no point, upon which different nations are more at
variance; and the policy of the American states themselves, on this
subject, while they were colonies, and since they have become independent,
has been exceedingly discordant. Independent of the differences, arising
from the population and size of the states, there will be found to be great
diversities among those, whose population and size nearly approach each
other. In Massachusetts, the house of representatives is composed of a
number between three and four hundred; in Pennsylvania, of not more than
one fifth of that number; and in New-York, of not more than one fifth. In
Pennsylvania the representatives do not bear a greater proportion to their
constituents, than one for every four or five thousand. In Rhode-Island and
Massachusetts they bear a proportion of at least one for every thousand.
And according to the old constitution of Georgia, the proportion may be
carried to one for every ten electors.
 <sup>
  <a href="#155">
   155
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 651.
 </b>
 Neither is there any ground to assert, that the ratio
between the
representatives and the people ought, upon principle, to be the same,
whether the latter be numerous or few. If the representatives from Virginia
were to be chosen by the standard of RhodeIsland, they would then amount to
five hundred; and in twenty or thirty years to one thousand. On the other
hand, the ratio of Pennsylvania applied to Delaware would reduce the
representative assembly to seven.
</p>
<p>
 Nothing can be more fallacious, than to found political calculations on
arithmetical principles. Sixty or seventy men may be more properly trusted
with a given degree of power, than six or seven. But it does not follow,
that six or seven hundred would be proportionably a better depositary. And
if the supposition is carried on to six or seven thousand, the whole
reasoning ought to be reversed. The truth is, that, in all cases, a certain
number seems necessary to secure the benefits of free consultation and
discussion; to guard against too easy a combination for improper purposes;
and to prevent hasty and ill-advised legislation. On the other hand the
number ought to be kept within a moderate limit, in order to avoid the
confusion, intemperance, and inconvenience of a multitude.

 It was a
famous saying of Cardinal De Retz, that every public assembly, consisting
of more than one hundred members, was a mere mob.
 <sup>
  <a href="#157">

 But surely this is
just as incorrect, as it would be to aver, that every one, which consisted
of ten members, would be wise.

 <b>
  § 652.

 The question then is, and for ever must be, in every
nation, a
mixed question of sound policy and discretion, with reference to its size,
its population, its institutions, its local and physical condition, and all
the other circumstances affecting its own interests and convenience. As a
present number, sixty-five was sufficient for all the exigencies of the
United States; and it was wisest and safest to leave all future questions
of increase to be judged of by the future condition and exigencies of the
Union. What ground could there be to suppose, that such a number chosen
biennially, and responsible to their constituents, would voluntarily betray
</p>
<p>
 their trusts, or refuse to follow the public will? The very state of the
country forbade the supposition. They would be watched with the jealousy
and the power of the state legislatures.
 <sup>
  <a href="#158">

 They would have the highest
inducements to preform their duty. And to suppose, that the possession of
power for so short a period could blind them to a sense of their own
interests, or tempt them to destroy the public liberties, was as
improbable, as any thing, which could be within the scope of the
imagination.

 At all events, if they were guilty of misconduct, their
removal would be inevitable; and their successors would be above all false
and corrupt conduct. For to reason otherwise would be equivalent to a
declaration of the universal corruption of all mankind, and the utter
impracticability of a republican government. The congress, which conducted
us through the revolution, was a less numerous body, than their successors
will be.

at pleasure, they were generally continued for three years. They held their
consultations in secret. They transacted all our foreign affairs. They held
the fate of their country in their hands during the whole war. Yet they
never betrayed our rights, or our interests. Nay, calumny itself never
ventured to whisper any thing against their purity or patriotism.

 The remark, made upon another occasion

hers of more than three hundred.

 Nothing can be more unfair and impolitic, than to
substitute for
argument an indiscriminate and unbounded jealousy, with which all reasoning
must be vain. The sincere friends of liberty, who give themselves up to the
extravagancies of this passion, inflict the most serious injury upon their
own cause. As there is a degree of depravity in mankind, which requires a
certain degree of circumspection and distrust; so there are other qualities
in human nature, which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence.
A republican government presupposes, and requires the existence of these
qualities in a higher degree, than any other form; and wholly to destroy
our reliance on them is to sap all the foundation, on which our liberties
must rest.

 The next objection was, that the house of
representatives would be
too small to possess a due knowledge of the interests of their
constituents. It was said, that the great extent of the United States, the
</p>
<p>
 variety of its interests, and occupations, and institutions would require a
very numerous body in order to bring home information necessary and proper
for wise legislation.

  § 655.

 In answer to this objection, it was admitted, that the
representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and circumstances
of his constituents. But this principle can extend no farther, than to
those interests and circumstances, to which the authority and care of the
representative relate. Ignorance of very minute objects, which do not lie
within the compass of legislation, is consistent with every attribute
necessary to the performance of the legislative trust.
 <sup>
  <a href="#168">
   168
  </a>
 </sup>
 If the argument,
indeed, required the most minute knowledge, applicable even to all the
professed objects of legislation, it would overturn itself; for the thing
would be utterly impracticable. No representative, either in the state or
national councils, ever could know, or even pretend to know, all arts, and
sciences, and trades, and subjects, upon which legislation may operate. One
of the great duties of a representative is, to inquire into, and to obtain
the necessary information to enable him to act wisely and correctly in
particular cases. And this is attained by bringing to the investigation of
such cases talents, industry, experience, and a spirit of comprehensive
inquiry. No one will pretend, that he, who is to make laws, ought not to be
well instructed in their nature, interpretation, and practical results. But
what would be said, if, upon such a theory, it was to be seriously urged,
that none, but practical lawyers, ought ever to be eligible as legislators?
The truth is, that we must rest
</p>
<p>
 satisfied with general attainments; and it is visionary to suppose, that
any one man can represent all the skill, and interests, and business, and
occupations of all his constituents in a perfect manner, whether they be
few or many. The most, that can be done, is, to take a comprehensive survey
of the general outlines; and to search, as occasion may require, for that
more intimate information, which belongs to particular subjects requiring
immediate legislation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 656.
 </b>
 It is by no means true, that a large representation is
necessary to
understand the interests of the people. It is not either theoretically, or
practically true, that a knowledge of those interests is augmented in
proportion to the increase of representatives.
 <sup>
  <a href="#169">
   169
  </a>
 </sup>
 The interests of the
state of New-York are probably as well understood by its sixty-five
representatives, as those of Massachusetts by its three or four hundred. In
fact, higher qualifications will usually be sought and required, where the
representatives are few, than where they are many. And there will also be a
higher ambition to serve, where the smallness of the number creates a
desirable distinction, than where it is shared with many, and of course
individual importance is essentially diminished.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 657.
 </b>
 Besides; in considering this subject, it is to be
recollected, that
the powers of the general government are limited; and embrace only such
objects, as are of a national character. Local information of peculiar
local interests is, consequently, of less value and importance, than it
would be in a state legislature, where the powers are general.
 <sup>
  <a href="#170">
   170
  </a>
 </sup>
 The
knowledge required of a national representative is, therefore, necessarily
of a
</p>
<p>
 more large and comprehensive character, than that of a mere state
representative. Minute information, and a thorough knowledge of local
interests, personal opinions, and private feelings, are far more important
to the latter than the former.
 <sup>
  <a href="#171">
   171
  </a>
 </sup>
 Nay, the very devotion to local views,
and feelings, and interests, which naturally tends to a narrow and selfish
policy, may be a just disqualification and reproach to a member of
congress.
 <sup>
  <a href="#172">
   172
  </a>
 </sup>
 A liberal and enlightened policy, a knowledge of national
rights, duties, and interests, a familiarity with foreign governments, and
diplomatic history, and a wide survey of the operations of commerce,
agriculture, and manufactures, seem indispensable to a lofty discharge of
his functions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#173">
   173
  </a>
 </sup>
 A knowledge of the peculiar interests, and products, and
institutions of the different states of the Union, is doubtless of great
value; but it is rather as it conduces to the performance of the higher
functions already spoken of, than as it sympathizes with the local
interests and feelings of a particular district, that it is to be
estimated.
 <sup>
  <a href="#174">
   174
  </a>
 </sup>
 And in regard to those local facts, which are chiefly of use
to a member of congress, they are precisely those, which are most easily
attainable from the documentary evidence in the departments of the national
government, or which lie open to an intelligent man in any part of the
state, which he may represent.
 <sup>
  <a href="#175">
   175
  </a>
 </sup>
 A knowledge of commerce, and taxation, and
manufactures, can be obtained with more certainty by inquiries conducted
through many, than through a single channel of communication. The
representatives of each state
</p>
<p>
 will generally bring with them a considerable knowledge of its laws, and of
the local interests of their districts. They will often have previously
served as members in the state legislatures; and thus have become, in some
measure, acquainted with all the local views and wants of the whole state.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 658.
 </b>
 The functions, too, of a representative in congress
require very
different qualifications and attainments, from those required in a state
legislature. Information relative to local objects is easily obtained in a
single state; for there is no difference in its laws, and its interests are
but little diversified. But the legislation of congress reaches over all
the states; and as the laws and local circumstances of all differ, the
information, which is requisite for safe legislation, is far more difficult
and various, and directs the attention abroad, rather than at home.
 <sup>
  <a href="#177">
   177

 </sup>
 Few
members, comparatively speaking, will be found ignorant of the local
interests of their district or state; but time, and diligence, and a rare
union of sagacity and public spirit, are indispensable to avoid egregious
mistakes in national measures.

<p>
 <b>
  § 659.

 The experience of Great Britain upon this subject
furnishes a very
instructive commentary. Of the five hundred and fifty-eight members of the
house of commons one ninth are elected by three hundred and sixty-four
persons; and one half by five thousand seven hundred and twenty-three
persons.
 <sup>
  <a href="#178">

 And this half certainly have little or no claim to be deemed
the guardians of the interests of the people, and indeed are
</p>
<p>
 notoriously elected by other interests.
 <sup>
  <a href="#179">

 It may be added, that
nothing is more common, than to select men for representatives of large and
populous cities and districts, who do not reside therein; and cannot be
presumed to be intimately acquainted with their local interests and
feelings. The choice, however, is made from high motives, a regard to
talent, public services, and political sagacity. And whatever may be the
defects of the representative system of Great Britain, very few of the
defects of its legislation have been imputed to the ignorance of the house
of commons of the true interests or circumstances of the people.

 In the history of the constitution it is a curious
fact, that with
some statesmen, possessing high political distinction, it was made a
fundamental objection against the establishment of any national
legislature, that if it " were composed of so numerous a body of men, as to
represent the interests of all the inhabitants of the United States in the
usual and true ideas of representation, the expense of supporting it would
be intolerably burthensome; and that if a few only were vested with a power

ribbons. In every society men of this class will command a superior degree
of respect; and if the government is so constituted, as to admit but few to
exercise its powers, it will, according to the natural course of things, be
in their hands. Men in the middling class, who are qualified as
representatives, will not be so anxious to be chosen, as those of the
first; and if they are, they will not have the means of so much influence.

 <b>
  § 662.

 It was answered, that the objection itself is of a very
extraordinary character; for while it is levelled against a pretended
oligarchy, in principle it strikes at the very root of a republican
government; for it supposes the people to be incapable of making a proper
choice of representatives, or indifferent to it, or utterly corrupt in the
exercise of the right of suffrage. It would not be contended, that the
first class of society, the men of talents, experience, and wealth, ought
to be
</p>
<p>
 constitutionally excluded from office. Such an attempt would not only be
unjust, but suicidal; for it would nourish an influence and faction within
the state, which, upon the very supposition, would continually exert its
whole means to destroy the government, and overthrow the liberties of the
people.
 <sup>
  <a href="#185">
   185

 What, then, is to be done? If the people are free to make the
choice, they will naturally make it from that class, whatever it may be,
which will in their opinion best promote their interests, and preserve
their liberties.

 Nor are the poor, any more than the rich, beyond

accustomed to the exercise of their power. Who are to be the objects of
their choice? Every citizen, whose merit may commend him to the esteem and
confidence of his fellow citizens. No qualification of wealth, or birth, or
religion, or civil profession, is recognised in the constitution; and
consequently, the people are free to choose from any rank of society
according to their pleasure.

 The persons, who shall be elected representatives, must
have all
the inducement to fidelity, vigilance, and a devotion to the interests of

from their known virtues, and estimable
</p>
<p>
 qualities, as well as from their talents. They must have a desire to
retain, and exalt their reputation, and be ambitious to deserve the
continuance of that public favour, by which they have been elevated. There
is in every breast a sensibility to marks of honour, of favour, of esteem,
and of confidence, which, apart from all considerations of interest, is
some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns.
 <sup>
  <a href="#189">

 But the interest of the
representative, which naturally binds him to his constituents, will be
strengthened by motives of a selfish character. His election is biennial;
and he must soon return to the common rank of a citizen, unless he is
re-elected. Does he desire office? Then that very desire will secure his
fidelity. Does he feel the value of public distinctions? Then his pride and
vanity will equally attach him to a government, which affords him an
opportunity to share in its honours and distinctions, and to the people,
who alone can confer them.

 Besides; he can make no law, which will not
weigh as heavily on himself and his friends, as on others; an he can
introduce no oppression, which must not be borne by himself, when he sinks
back to the common level. As for usurpation, or a perpetuation of his
authority, independent of the popular will, that is hopeless, until the

liberties, and are ready to become the voluntary slaves of any despot.

  § 665.

 The only perceptible difference between the case of a
representative in congress, and in the state legislature, as to this point,
is, that the one may be elected by five or six hundred citizens, and the
other by as many thousands.
 <sup>
  <a href="#193">

 Even this is true only in particular states;
for the representatives in Massachusetts (who are all chosen by the towns)
may be elected by six thousand citizens; nay, by any larger number,
according to the population of the town. But giving the objection its full
force, could this circumstance make any solid objection? Are not the
senators in several of the states chosen by as large a number? Have they
been found more corrupt, than the representatives? Is the objection
supported by reason? Can it be said, that five or six thousand citizens are
more easily corrupted, than five or six hundred?
 <sup>
  <a href="#194">
   194
  </a>
 </sup>
 That the aggregate
</p>
<p>
 mass will be more under the influence of intrigue, than a portion of it? Is
the consequence, deducible from the objection, admissible? If it is, then
we must deprive the people of all choice of their public servants in all
cases, where numbers are not required.
 <sup>
  <a href="#195">
   195
  </a>
 </sup>
 What, then, is to be done in
those states, where the governors are by the state constitution to be
chosen by the people? Is the objection warranted by facts? The
representation in the British house of commons (as has been already stated)
very little exceeds the proportion of one for every thirty thousand
inhabitants.
 <sup>
  <a href="#196">
   196
  </a>
 </sup>
 Is it true, that the house of commons have elevated
themselves upon the ruin of the many? Is it true, that the representatives
of boroughs have been more faithful, or wise, or honest, or patriotic, than
those of cities and of counties? Let us come to our own country. The
districts in New-Hampshire, in which the senators are chosen immediately by
the people, are nearly as large, as will be necessary for her
representatives in congress. Those in Massachusetts come from districts
having a larger population; and those in New-York from districts still
larger. In New-York and Albany the members of assembly are elected by
nearly as many voters, as will be required for a member of congress,
calculating on the number of sixty-five only. In some of the counties of
Pennsylvania the state representatives are elected in districts nearly as
large, as those required for the federal representatives. In the city of
Philadelphia (composed of sixty thousand inhabitants) every elector has a
right to vote for each of the representatives in the state legislature; and
actually elects a single member to the executive council.
 <sup>
  <a href="#197">
   197
  </a>
 </sup>
 These are
facts, which
</p>
<p>
 demonstrate the fallacy of the objection; for no one will pretend, that the
rights and liberties of these states are not as well maintained, and as
well understood by their senators and representatives, as those of any
other states in the Union by theirs. There is yet one stronger case, that
of Connecticut; for there one branch of the legislature is so constituted,
that each member of it is elected by the whole state.

 The remaining objection was, that there was no security, that the
number of members would be augmented from time to time, as the progress of
the population might demand.

 <b>
  § 667.

 It is obvious, that this objection is exclusively
founded upon the
supposition, that the people will be too corrupt, or too indifferent, to
select proper representatives; or, that the representatives, when chosen,
will totally disregard the true interests of their constituents, or
wilfully betray them. Either supposition (if the preceding remarks are well
founded) is equally inadmissible. There are, however, some additional
considerations, which are entitled to great weight. In the first place, it
is observable, that the federal constitution will not suffer in comparison
with the state constitutions in regard to the security, which is provided
for a gradual augmentation of the number of representatives. In many of
them the subject has been left to the discretion of the legislature; and
experience has thus far demonstrated not only, that the power is safely
lodged, but that a gradual increase of representatives (where it could take
place) has kept pace with that of the constituents.
 <sup>
  <a href="#200">

 </sup>
 In the next place,
as a new census is to
</p>
<p>
 take place within every successive ten years, for the avowed purpose of
readjusting the representation from time to time, according, to the
national exigencies, it is no more to be imagined, that congress will
abandon its proper duty in this respect, than in respect to any other power
confided to it. Every power may be abused; every duty may be corruptly
deserted. But, as the power to correct the evil will recur at least
biennially to the people, it is impossible, that there can long exist any
public abuse or dereliction of duty, unless the people connive at, and
encourage the violation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#201">
   201
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the next place, there is a peculiarity in the
federal constitution, which must favour a constitutional augmentation of
the representatives. One branch of the national legislature is elected by
the people; the other, by the states. In the former, consequently, the
large states will have more weight; in the latter, the smaller states will
have the advantage. From this circumstance, it may be fairly inferred, that
the larger states, and especially those of a growing population, will be
strenuous advocates for increasing the number and weight of that part of
the legislature, in which their influence predominates.
 <sup>
  <a href="#202">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 668.
 </b>
 It may be said, that there will be an antagonist
influence in the
senate to prevent an augmentation. But, upon a close view, this objection
will be found to lose most of its weight. In the first place, the house of
representatives, being a co-ordinate branch, and directly emanating from
the people, and speaking the known and declared sense of the majority of
the people, will, upon every question of this nature, have
</p>
<p>
 no small advantage, as to the means of influence and resistance. In the
next place, the contest will not be to be decided merely by the votes of
great states and small states, opposed to each other, but by states of
intermediate sizes, approaching the two extremes by gradual advances. They
will naturally arrange themselves on the one side, or the other, according
to circumstances; and cannot be calculated upon, as identified permanently
with either. Besides; in the new states, and those, whose population is
advancing, whether they are great or small, there will be a constant
tendency to favour augmentations of the representatives; and, indeed, the
large states may compel it by making re-apportionments and augmentations
mutual conditions of each other.
 <sup>
  <a href="#203">
   203
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the third place, the house of
representatives will possess an exclusive power of proposing supplies for
the support or government; or, in other words, it will hold the
purse-strings of the nation. This must for ever give it a powerful
influence in the operations of the government; and enable it effectually to
redress every serious grievance.
 <sup>
  <a href="#204">

 The house of representatives will, at
all times, have as deep an interest in maintaining the interests of the
people, as the senate can have in maintaining that of the states.

 Such is a brief view of the objections urged against
this part of
the constitution, and of the answers given to them. Time, as has been
already intimated, has already settled them by its own irresistible
demonstrations. But it is impossible to withhold our tribute of admiration
from those enlightened statesmen, whose
</p>
<p>
 profound reasoning, and mature wisdom, enabled the people to see the true
path of safety. What was then prophecy and argument has now become fact. At
each successive census, the number of representatives has been gradually
augmented.
 <sup>

 In 1792, the ratio adopted was 33.000, which gave an
aggregate of one hundred and six representatives. In 1802, the same ratio
was adopted, which gave an aggregate of one hundred and forty-one members.
In 1811, the ratio adopted was 35.000, which gave an aggregate of one
hundred and eighty-one members. In 1822, the ratio adopted was 40.000,
which gave an aggregate of two hundred and ten members. In 1832, the ratio
adopted was 47.700, which gave an aggregate of two hundred and forty

 <b>
  § 670.
 </b>
 In the mean time, the house of representatives has silently
acquired vast influence and power over public opinion by its immediate
connexion and sympathy with the people. No complaint has been urged, or
could now with truth be urged, that it did not understand, or did not
represent, the interests of the people, or bring to the public councils a
competent knowledge of, and devotion to, the local interests and feelings
of its constituents. Nay; so little is, and so little has the force of this
objection been felt, that several states have voluntarily preferred to
elect their representatives by a general ticket, rather than by districts.
And the electors for president and vice-president are more frequently
chosen in that, than in and other manner. The representatives are not, and
never have
</p>
<p>
 been, chosen exclusively from any high, or privileged class of society. At
this moment, and at all previous times, the house has been composed of men
from almost every rank and class of society; planters, farmers,
manufacturers, mechanics, lawyers, physicians, and divines; the rich, and
the poor; the educated, and the uneducated men of genius; the young, and
the old; the eloquent, and the taciturn; the statesman of a half century,
and the aspirant, just released from his academical studies. Merit of every
sort has thus been able to assert its claims, and occasionally to obtain
its just rewards. And if any complaint could justly be made, it would be,
that the choice had sometimes been directed by a spirit of intolerance,
that forgot every thing but its own creed; or by a spirit of party, that
remembered every thing but its own duty. Such infirmities, however, are
inseparable from the condition of human nature; and their occurrence proves
nothing more, than that the moral, like the physical world is occasionally
visited by a whirlwind, or deluged by a storm.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 671.
 </b>
 It remains only to take notice of two qualifications of
the general
principle of representation, which are engrafted on the clause. One is,
that each state shall have at least one representative; the other is that
already quoted, that the number of representatives shall not exceed one for
every 30.000. The former was indispensable in order to secure to each state
a just representation in each branch of the legislature; which, as the
powers of each branch were not exactly co-extensive, and especially, as the
power of originating taxation was exclusively vested in the house of
representatives, was indispensable to preserve the equality of the small
states, and to reconcile them to a surrender of their sovereignty. This
proviso was
</p>
<p>
 omitted in the first draft of the constitution, though proposed in one of
the preceding resolutions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#208">
   208
  </a>
 </sup>
 But it was adopted without resistance, when
the draft passed under the solemn discussion of the convention.
 <sup>
  <a href="#209">
   209
  </a>
 </sup>
 The other
was a matter of more controversy. The original limitation proposed was
40.000;
 <sup>
  <a href="#210">
   210
  </a>
 </sup>
 and it was not until the very last day of the session of the
convention, that the number was reduced to 30.000.
 <sup>
  <a href="#211">
   211
  </a>
 </sup>
 The object of fixing
some limitation was to prevent the future existence of a very numerous and
unwieldy house of representatives. The friends of a national government had
no fears, that the body would ever become too small for real, effective,
protecting service. The danger was, that from the natural impulses of the
popular will, and the desire of ambitious candidates to attain office, the
number would be soon swollen to an unreasonable size, so that it would at
once generate, and combine factions, obstruct deliberations, and introduce
and perpetuate turbulent and rash counsels.

 <b>
  § 672.
 </b>
 On this subject, let the Federalist speak in its own
fearless and
expressive language. "In all legislative assemblies the greater the number
composing them may be, the fewer will the men be, who will, in fact, direct
their proceedings.
 <sup>
  <a href="#213">
   213
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the first place, the more numerous any assembly may
be, of whatever characters composed, the greater is known to be the
</p>
<p>
 ascendancy of passion over reason. In the next place, the larger the
number, the greater will be the proportion of members of limited
information and weak capacities. Now, it is precisely on characters of this
description, that the eloquence and address of the few are known to act
with all their force. In the ancient republics, where the whole body of the
people assembled in person, a single orator, or an artful statesman, was
generally seen to rule with as complete a sway, as if a scepter had been
placed in his single hand. On the same principle, the more multitudinous a
representative assembly may be rendered, the more it will partake of the
infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people. Ignorance will
be the dupe of cunning; and passion the slave of sophistry and declamation.
The people can never err more than in supposing, that in multiplying their
representatives beyond a certain limit, they strengthen the barrier against
the government of a few. Experience will for ever admonish them, that, on
the contrary, after securing a sufficient number for the purposes of
safety, of local information, and of diffusive sympathy, they will
counteract their own views by every addition to their representatives. The
countenance of the government may become more democratic; but the soul,
that animates it, will be more oligarchic. The machine will be enlarged,
but the fewer, and often the more secret, will be the springs, by which its
motions are directed."

 <b>
  § 673.
 </b>
 As a fit conclusion of this part of the subject it may be
remarked,
that congress, at its first session in 1789, in pursuance of a desire
expressed by several of the state conventions, in favour of further
declaratory and restrictive amendments to the constitution, proposed twelve
additional articles. The first was on the very subject now under
consideration, and was expressed in the following terms: "After the first
enumeration required by the first article of the constitution, there shall
be one representative for every thirty thousand, until the number shall
amount to one hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by
congress, that there shall not be less than one hundred representatives,
nor less than one for every forty thousand persons, until the number of
representatives shall amount to two hundred; after which, the proportion
shall be so regulated by congress, that there shall not be less than two
hundred representatives, nor more than one representative for every fifty
thousand."
 <sup>
  <a href="#215">
   215
  </a>
 </sup>
 This amendment was never ratified by a competent number of
the states to be incorporated into the constitution.
 <sup>
  <a href="#216">
   216
  </a>
 </sup>
 It was probably
thought, that the whole subject was safe, where it was already lodged; and
that congress ought to be left free to exercise a sound discretion,
according to the future exigencies of the nation, either to increase, or
diminish the number of representatives.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 674.
 </b>
 There yet remain two practical questions of no
inconsiderable
importance, connected with the
</p>
<p>
 clause of the constitution now under consideration. One is, what are to be
deemed direct taxes within the meaning of the clause. The other is, in what
manner the apportionment of representatives is to be made. The first will
naturally come under review in examining the powers of congress, and the
constitutional limitations upon those powers; and may, therefore, for the
present, be passed over. The other was a subject of much discussion at the
time, when the first apportionment was before congress after the first
census was taken; and has been recently revived with new and increased
interest and ability. It deserves, therefore, a very deliberate
examination.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 675.
 </b>
 The language of the constitution is, that
"representatives and
direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, &amp;c. according
to their respective numbers;" and at the first view it would not seem to
involve the slightest difficulty. A moment's reflection will dissipate the
illusion, and teach us, that there is a difficulty intrinsic in the very
nature of the subject. In regard to direct taxes, the natural course would
be to assume a particular sum to be raised, as three millions of dollars;
and to apportion it among the states according to their relative numbers.
But even here, there will always be a very small fractional amount
incapable of exact distribution, since the numbers in each state will never
exactly coincide with any common divisor, or give an exact aliquot part for
each state without any remainder. But, as the amount may be carried through
a long series of descending money fractions, it may be ultimately reduced
to the smallest fraction of any existing, or even imaginary coin.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 676.
 </b>
 But the difficulty is far otherwise in regard to
representatives.
Here, there can be no subdivision of the unit; each state must be entitled
to an entire representative, and a fraction of a representative is
incapable of apportionment. Yet it will be perceived at once, that it is
scarcely possible, and certainly is wholly improbable, that the relative
numbers in each state should bear such an exact proportion to the
aggregate, that there should exist a common divisor for all, which should
leave no fraction in any state. Such a case never yet has existed; and in
all human probability it never will. Every common divisor, hitherto
applied, has left a fraction greater, or smaller, in every state;
 <sup>
  <a href="#217">
   217
  </a>
 </sup>
 and what
has been in the past must continue to be for the future. Assume the whole
population to be three, or six, or nine, or twelve millions, or any other
number; if you follow the injunctions of the constitution, and attempt to
apportion the representatives according to the numbers in each state, it
will be found to be absolutely impossible. The theory, however true,
becomes practically false in its application. Each state may have assigned
a relative proportion of representatives up to a given number, the whole
being divisible by some common divisor; but the fraction of population
belonging to each beyond that point is left unprovided for. So that the
apportionment is, at best, only an approximation to the rule laid down by
the constitution, and not a strict compliance with the rule. The fraction
in one state may be ten times as great, as that in another; and so may
differ in each state in any assignable mathematical proportion. What then
is to be done? Is the constitution to be wholly disre-
</p>
<p>
 garded on this point? Or is it to be followed out in its true spirit,
though unavoidably differing from the letter, by the nearest approximation
to it? If an additional representative can be assigned to one state beyond
its relative proportion to the whole population, it is equally true, that
it can be assigned to all, that are in a similar predicament. If a fraction
admits of representation in any case, what prohibits the application of the
rule to all fractions? The only constitutional limitation seems to be, that
no state shall have more than one representative for every thirty thousand
persons. Subject to this, the truest rule seems to be, that the
apportionment ought to be the nearest practical approximation to the terms
of the constitution; and the rule ought to be such, that it shall always
work the same way in regard to all the states, and be as little open to
cavil, or controversy, or abuse, as possible.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 677.
 </b>
 But it may be asked, what are the first steps to be
taken in order
to arrive at a constitutional apportionment? Plainly, by taking the
aggregate of population in all the states, (according to the constitutional
rule,) and then ascertain the relative proportion of the population of each
state to the population of the whole. This is necessarily so in regard to
direct taxes;
 <sup>
  <a href="#218">
   218
  </a>
 </sup>
 and
</p>
<p>
 there is no reason to say, that it can, or ought to be otherwise in regard
to representatives; for that would be to contravene the very injunctions of
the constitution, which require the like rule of apportionment in each
case. In the one, the apportionment may be run down below unity; in the
other, it cannot. But this does not change the nature of the rule, but only
the extent of its application.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 678.
 </b>
 In 1790, a bill was introduced into the house of
representatives,
giving one representative for every thirty thousand, and leaving, the
fractions unrepresented; thus producing an inequality, which was greatly
complained of. It passed the house; and was amended in the senate by
allowing an additional representative to the states having the largest
fractions. The house finally concurred in the amendment, after a warm
debate. The history of these proceedings is summarily stated by the
biographer of Washington, as follows: -- "Construing," says he, "the
constitution to authorize a process, by which the whole number of
representatives should be ascertained on the whole population of the United
States, and afterwards apportioned among the several states according to
their respective numbers, the senate applied the number thirty thousand, as
a divisor, to the total population, and taking the quotient, which was one
hundred and twenty, as the number of representatives given by the ratio,
which had been adopted in the house, where the bill originated, they
apportioned that number among the several states by that ratio, until as
many representatives, as it
</p>
<p>
 would give, were allotted to each. The residuary members were then
distributed among the states having the highest fractions. Without
professing the principle, on which this apportionment was made, the
amendment of the senate merely allotted to the states respectively the
number of members, which the process just mentioned would give.
 <sup>
  <a href="#219">
   219
  </a>
 </sup>
 The
result was a more equitable apportionment of representatives to population,
and a still more exact accordance, than was found in the original bill,
with the prevailing sentiment, which, both within doors and without, seemed
to require, that the popular branch of the legislature should consist of as
many members, as the fundamental laws of the government would admit. If the
rule of construing that instrument was correct, the amendment removed
objections, which were certainly well founded, and was not easily
assailable by the advocates of a numerous representative body.But the rule
was novel, and overturned opinions, which had been generally assumed, and
were supposed to be settled. In one branch of the legislature, it had been
already rejected; and in the other, the majority in its favour was only
one."

 The debate in the two houses, however, was purely
political, and
the division of the votes purely geographical; the southern states voting
against it, and the northern in its favour.
 <sup>
  <a href="#221">
   221

 </sup>
 The president returned the
bill with two objections." 1. That the constitu-
</p>
<p>
 tion has prescribed, that representatives shall be apportioned among, the
several states according to their respective numbers; and there is no
proportion or divisor, which, applied to the respective numbers of the
states, will yield the number and allotment of representatives proposed by
the bill.  2. The constitution has also provided, that the number of
representatives shall not exceed one for thirty thousand, which restriction
is by the context, and by fair and obvious construction, to be applied to
the several and respective numbers of the states, and the bill has allotted
to eight of the states more than one for thirty thousand."
 <sup>
  <a href="#222">
   222

 The bill was
accordingly lost, two thirds of the house not being in its favour. It is
understood, that the president's cabinet was greatly divided on the
question.

 <b>
  § 680.
 </b>
 The second reason assigned by the president against the
bill was
well founded in fact, and entirely conclusive. The other, to say the least
of it, is as open to question, as any one, which can well be imagined in a
case of real difficulty of construction. It assumes, as its basis, that a
common ratio, or divisor, is to be taken, and applied to each state, let
the fractions and inequalities left be whatever they may. Now, this is a
plain departure from the terms of the constitution. It is not there said,
that any such ratio shall be taken. The language is, that the
representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to
their respective numbers, that is, according to the proportion of the whole
population of each state to the aggregate of all the states. To apportion
according to a ratio, short of the whole number in a state, is not an
apportionment according to the respective
</p>
<p>
 numbers of the state. If it is said, that it is impracticable to follow the
meaning of the terms literally, that may be admitted; but it does not
follow, that they are to be wholly disregarded, or language substituted
essentially different in its import and effect. If we must depart, we must
depart as little as practicable. We are to act on the doctrine of cypres,
or come as nearly as possible to the rule of the constitution. If we are at
liberty to adopt a rule varying from the terms of the constitution, arguing
ab inconvenienti, then it is clearly just as open to others to reason on
the other side from opposing inconvenience and injustice.

 It was obvious, that the power ought to reside somewhere; and must be

department thereof. The friends of state powers would naturally rest
satisfied with leaving it with the state executive; and the friends of the
national

provisions existed sufficient to preserve its due execution. The provision,

 Each of these privileges is of great practical value and

 commons elect their own speaker; but he must be approved by the king.
 <sup>
  <a href="#227">
   227

 This approval is now altogether a matter of course; but anciently, it
seems, the king intimated his wish previously, in order to avoid the
necessity of a refusal; and it was acceded to.
 <sup>
  <a href="#228">

 The very language used by
the speakers in former times, in order to procure the approval of the

<p>
 a disposition to undue subserviency.
 <sup>

 A similar power of approval existed
in the royal governors in many of the colonies before the revolution.  The
exclusive
</p>
<p>
 right of choosing a speaker, without any appeal to, or approval by any
other department of the government, is an improvement upon the British
system.  It secures
</p>
<p>
 a more independent and unlimited choice on the part of the house, according
to the merits of the individual, and their own sense of duty.  It avoids
those incon-
</p>
<p>
 veniences and collisions, which might arise from the interposition of a
negative in times of high party excitement.  It extinguishes a constant
source of jealousy
</p>
<p>
 and heart-burning; and a disposition on one side to exert an undue
influence, and on the other, to assume a hostile opposition.  It relieves
the executive depart-

 ment from all the embarrassments of opposing the popular will; and the
house from all the irritation of not consulting the cabinet wishes.

 The other power, the sole power of impeachment, has a far wider
scope and operation.  An impeachment, as described in the common law of
England,
</p>
<p>
 is a presentment by the house of commons, the most solemn grand inquest of
the whole kingdom, to the house of lords, the most high and supreme court
of
</p>
<p>
 criminal jurisdiction of the kingdom.
 <sup>
  <a href="#230">

 The articles of impeachment are a
kind of hill of indictment found by the commons, and tried by the lords,
who are, in cases

 of misdemeanors, considered, not only as their own peers, but as the peers
of the whole nation.

 The origin and history of the jurisdiction of

 To what classes of offenders

this sort in both countries is to reach high and potent offenders, such as
might be
</p>
<p>
 presumed to escape punishment in the ordinary tribunals, either from their
own extraordinary influence, or from the imperfect organization and powers
of those
</p>
<p>
 tribunals.
 <sup>

 These prosecutions are, therefore, conducted by the
representatives of the nation,' in their public capacity, in the face of
the nation, and upon a
</p>
<p>
 responsibility, which is at once felt, and reverenced by the whole
community.
 <sup>
  <a href="#234">

 The notoriety of the proceedings; the solemn manner, in which
they are conducted;
</p>
<p>
 the deep extent, to which they affect the reputations of the accused; the
ignominy of a conviction, which is to be known through all time; and the
glory of an acquittal, which ascertains and confirms innocence; -- these
are all calculated to produce a vivid and lasting interest in the public
mind; and to give to such prosecutions, when necessary, a vast importance,
both as a check to crime, and an incitement to virtue.

 <b>
  § 687.
 </b>
 This subject will be resumed hereafter, when the other
provisions
of the constitution, in regard to impeachments, come under review.  It does
not appear, that the vesting of the power of impeachment in the house of
representatives was deemed a matter of serious doubt or question, either in
the convention, or with the people.
 <sup>
  <a href="#235">

 </sup>
 If the true spirit of the
constitution is consulted, it would seem difficult to arrive at any other
conclusion, than of its fitness.  It is designed, as a method of national
inquest into the conduct of public men.  If such is the design, who can so
properly be the inquisitors
</p>
<p>
 for the nation, as the representatives of the people themselves? They must
be presumed to be watchful of the interests; alive to the sympathies, and
ready to redress the grievances, of the people. If it is made their duty to
bring official delinquents to justice, they can scarcely fail of performing
it without public denunciation, and political desertion, on the part of
their con-
stituents.

<li><a id="7"></a> Mr. Burke, in his Reflections on the French Revolution, has treated the
subject of the mischiefs of an indirect choice only by the people of their
representative in a masterly manner. He has demonstrated, that such a
system must remove all real responsibility to the people from the
representative. Mr. Jefferson has expressed his approbation of the
principle of a direct choice in a very qualified manner. He says, "I
approve of the greater house being chosen by the people directly. For,
though I think a house so chosen will be very inferior to the present
congress, will be very ill qualified to legislate for the Union, for
foreign nations, &amp;c.; yet this evil does not weigh against the good of
preserving inviolate the fundamental principle, that the people ought not
to be taxed but by representatives chosen immediately by themselves." 2

<li><a id="10"></a> 1 Black.Comm. 171, 172. -- Mr.Justice Blackstone * has remarked, * 1 1 Black. Comm. 171.  "That the true reason of requiring any qualification with regard to
property in voters is to exclude such persons, as are in so mean a
situation, that they are esteemed to have no will of their own. If these
persons had votes, they would be tempted to dispose of them under some
undue influence or other. This would give a great, an artful, or a wealthy
man a larger share in elections, than is consistent with general liberty.
If it were probable, that every man would give his vote freely and without
influence of any kind, then, upon the true theory and genuine principles of
liberty, every member of the community, however poor, should have a vote in
election those delegates, to whose charge is committed the disposal of his
property, his liberty, and his live. But since that can hardly be expected
in persons of indigent fortunes, or such as the under the immediate
dominion of others, all popular states have been obliged to establish
certain qualifications, thereby some, who are suspected to have no will of
their own, are excluded from voting, in order to set other individuals,
whose will bay be supposed independent, more thoroughly upon a level with
each other." Similar reasoning might be employed to justify other
exclusions, besides those founded upon a want of property.</li>

<li><a id="32"></a> Mr. Burke manifestly thought, that no system of representative
government could be safe without a large admixture of different persons and
interests. "Nothing," say he, "is a due and adequate representation of a
state, that does not represent its ability, as well as is property. But as
ability is a vigorous and active principle, and as property is sluggish,
inert, and timid, it can never be safe from the invasion of ability, unless
it be, out of all proportion, predominant in the representation."*  In a
subsequent page of his Reflections on the French Revolution, be discussed
the then favorite theory of representation proposed for the constitution of
France, upon the triple basis of territory, population, and taxation, and
demonstrates, with great clearness, its inconvenience, inequality, and
inconsistency. The representatives, too, were to be chosen indirectly, by
electors appointed by electors, who were again chosen by other electors. "
The member," says Mr. Burke, "who goes to the National Assembly, is not
chosen by the people, nor accountable to them. There are three elections
before he is chosen; two sets of magistrates intervene between him and the
primary assembly, so as to render him, as I have said, an ambassador of a
state, and not the representative of the people within a state." So much
for mere theory in the hands of visionary end speculative statesmen. * Burke's Reelections on the French Revolution. See also Paley's

<li><a id="34"></a> Mr. Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, insists with great earnestness
upon the impropriety of allowing to different counties in that state, the
same number of representatives, without any regard to their relative
population.* And yet in the new constitution adopted in 1830-1831, Virginia
has adhered to the save system in principle, and her present representation
is apportioned upon an arbitrary and unequal basis.</li>

<li><a id="36"></a> Mr. Wilson in his Lectures, considers the inequality of representation
in the house of commons, as a prominent defect in the British government.
But his objections are mainly urged against the mode of apportioning the
representation, and not against the qualifications of the voters.*  In the
reform now under the consideration of parliament, there is a very great
diversity of electoral qualifications allowed, and apparently supported by
all parties. Mr. Burke in his Reflections on the French Revolution, holds
doctrine essentially different in many points from Mr. Wilson. See also in
Winne's Eunomus, Dialogue 3, § 18, 19, 20, an ingenious defence of the
existing system in Great-Britain.</li>

Elliot's Debates, 209 -- Mr. Burke in his, Speech to the Electors of
Bristol, in 1774, has treated this subject with great candour, and dignity,
and ability. "Parliament," said he, "is not a congress of ambassadors from
different and hostile interests, which interests each must maintain, as an
agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates. But parliament is a
deliberative assembly of one nation with one interest, that of the whole;
where not local purposes, not local prejudices, ought to guide; but the
general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole. You choose a
member indeed; but then you have chosen him, he is not a member of Bristol,
but he is a member of parliament." See, on this subject, 1 Tuck. Black.

<li><a id="46"></a> The Federalist, No. 52, 57.</li>
<li><a id="47"></a> Dr. Paley, with his usual practical sense, has remarked, in regard to
the composition, and tenure of office, of the British house of commons,
that, "the number, the fortune, and quality of the members; the variety of
interests and characters among them; above all, the temporary duration of
their power, and the change of men, which every new election produces, are
so many securities to the public, as well against the subjection of their
judgments to any external dictation, as against the formation of a junto in
their won body, sufficiently powerful to govern their decisions. The
representatives are so intermixed with the constituents, and the
constituents with the rest of the people, that they cannot, without a
partiality too flagrant to be endured, impose any burthen upon the subject,
in which they do not share themselves. Nor scarcely can they adopt an
advantageous regulation, in which their own interests will not participate
of the advantage." Paley's Moral Philosophy, B. 6, ch. 7.</li>

<li><a id="92"></a> Lork Coke has with much gravity enumerated the proper qualifications of
a parliament-man, drawing the resemblances from the properties of the
elephant. First, that he should be without gall; that is, without malice,
rancour, heat, and envy. Secondly, that he should be constant, inflexible,
and not to be bowed, or turned from the right, either for fear, reward, or
favour, nor in judgment respect persons. Thirdly, that he should be of a rip
e memory, that remembering perils past, he might remember dangers to come.
Fourthly, that though he be of the greatest strength and understanding, yet
he be sociable, and go in companies; and fifthly, that he philanthropic,
showing the way to every man.*  Whatever one may now think of this quaint
analogy, these qualities would not, in our day, be thought a bad
enumeration of the proper qualities of a good modern member of parliament,
or congress. * 4 Instit. 3.</li>

<li><a id="214"></a> The Federalist, No. 58. -- Mr. Ames, in n debate in congress, in 1789,
on amending the constitution in regard to representation, observed, "By
enlarging the representation, we lessen the chance of selecting men of the
greatest wisdom and abilities; because small districts may be conducted by
intrigue; but in large districts nothing but real dignity of character can
secure an election."* Unfortunately, the experience of * 2 Lloyd's Debates, 183.  the United States has not justified the belief, that large districts will
always choose men of the greatest wisdom, abilities, and real dignity.</li>

<li><a id="218"></a> "By the constitution," says Mr. Chief Judice Marshall in delivering the
opinion of the court, "direct taxation, in its application to states, shall
be apportioned to numbers. Representation is not made the foundation of
taxation. If, under the enumeration of a representative for every 30,000
souls, one state had been found to contain 59,000 and an other 60,000, the
first would have been entitled to only one representative, and the last to
two. Their taxes, however, would not have been as one to two, but as
fifty-nine to sixty."* This is perfectly correct, because the constitution
prohibits more than one representative for every 30,000. But if one state
contain 100,000 souls, and another * Loughborough v. Blake, 5 Wheaton's R. 317, 320.</li>
<li><a id="219"></a> The words of the bill were, "That from and after the third day of March,
      1793, the house of representatives shall be composed of one hundred and
      twenty-seven members, elected within the several states according to the
      following apportionment, that is to say, within the state of
New-Hampshire,
      five, within the state of Massachusetts, sixteen," &amp;c. &amp;c. enumerating all
      the states.</li>

<li><a id="225"></a> Mr. Jefferson's opinion, given on the apportionment bill in 1792,
      presents all the lending reasons against the doctrine of apportioning the
      representatives in any other manner than by a ratio without regard to
     fractions. It is as follows: "The constitution has declared that 'representatives and direct taxes
shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective
numbers;' that 'the number of representatives shall not exceed one for
every 30,000, but each state shall have, at least, one representative; and,
until such enumeration shall be made, the state of NewHampshire shall be
entitled to choose three, Massachusetts,' &amp;c. "The bill for apportioning representatives among the several states,
without explaining any principle at all, which may show its conformity with
the constitution, or guide future apportionments, says, that NewHampshire
shall have three members, Massachusetts sixteen, &amp;c. We are, therefore, to
find by experiment what has been the principle of the  bill; to do which, it is proper to state the federal or representable
numbers of each state, and the members allotted to them by the bill. They
are as follows: 
<pre>
Vermont,                   85,532     3   It happens that this representation,

"The first member of the clause of the constitution above cited, is
express -- that representatives shall be apportioned among the several
states according to their respective numbers; that is to say, they shall be
apportioned by some common ratio, for proportion and ratio are equivalent
words; and it is the definition of proportion among numbers, that they have
a ratio common to all, or, in other words, a common divisor. Now, trial
will show that there is no common ratio, or divisor, which, applied to the
numbers of each state, will give to them the number of re-presentatives
allotted in this bill; for, trying the several ratios of 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
the allotments would be as follows:

"It will be said, that, though for taxes there may always be found a
divisor, which will apportion them among the states according to numbers
exactly, without leaving any remainder; yet, for representatives, there can
be no such common ratio, or divisor, which, applied to the several numbers,
will divide them exactly, without a remainder or fraction. I answer, then,
that taxes must be divided exactly, and representatives as nearly as the
nearest ratio will admit, and the fractions must be neglected; because the
constitution wills, absolutely, that there be an apportionment, or common
ratio; and if any fractions result from the operation, it has left them
unprovided for. In fact, it could not but foresee that such fractions would
result, and it meant to submit to them. It knew they would be in favour of
one part of the Union at one time, and of another part of it at another, so
as, in the end, to balance occasional inequalities. But, instead of such a
single common ratio, or uniform divisor, as prescribed by the constitution,
the bill has applied two ratios, at least, to the different states to wit,
that of 30,026 to the seven following: Rhode-Island, New-York,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia; and that of 27,770
to the eight others; namely,  Vermont, New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New-Jersey, Delaware,
North Carolina, and South Carolina.  As follows:

"And if two ratios may be applied, then fifteen may, and the distribution
become arbitrary, instead of being apportioned to numbers.
    
     "Another member of the clause of the constitution, which has been cited,
says, 'the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000,
but each state shall have, at least, one representative.' This last phrase
proves that it had in contemplation, that all fractions, or numbers below
the common ratio, were to be unrepresented; and it provides specially, that
in the case of a state whose whole number shall be below the common ratio,
one representative shall be given to it.  This is the single instance where
it allowsrepresentation to any smaller number than the common ratio, and,
by providing specially for it in this, shows it was understood, that,
without special provision, the smaller number would, in this ease, be
involved in the general principle. "The first phrase of the above citation, that 'the number of
representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000,' is violated by this
bill, which has given to eight states a number exceeding one for every
30,000, to wit, one for every 27,770. "In answer to this, it is said, that this phrase may mean either the
thirty thousands in each slate, or the thirty thousands in the whole Union;
and that, in the latter case, it serves only to find the amount of the
whole representation, which, in the present state of population, is one
hundred and twenty members.  Suppose the phrase might bear both meanings,
which will common sense apply to it?  Which did the universal understanding
of our country apply to it?  Which did the senate and representatives apply
to it during the pendency of the first bill, and even till an advanced
stage of this second bill, when an ingenious gentleman found out the
doctrine of fractions -- a doctrine so difficult and inobvious, as to be
rejected, at first sight, by the very persons who afterwards be-  came its most zealous advocates?  The phrase stands in the midst of a
number of others, every one of which relates to states in their separate
capacity.  Will not plain common sense, then, understand it, like the rest
of its context, to relate to states in their separate capacities? "But if the phrase of one for 30,000, is only meant to give the aggregate
of representatives, and not at all to influence their apportionment among
the states, then the one hundred and twenty being once found, in order to
apportion them, we must recur to the former rule, which does it according
to the numbers of the respective states; and we must take the nearest
common divisor as the ratio of distribution, that is to say, that divisor,
which, applied to every state, gives to them such numbers as, added
together, come nearest to 120.  This nearest common ratio will be found to
be 28,858, and will distribute 119 of the 120 members, leaving only a
single residuary one.  It will be found, too, to place 96,648 fractional
numbers in the eight northernmost states, and 105,582, in the southernmost.

"Whatever may have been the intention, the effect of rejecting the nearest
divisor, (which leaves but one residuary member,) and adopting a distant
one, (which leaves eight,) is merely to take a member from New-York and
Pennsylvania each, and give them to Vermont and New-  Hampshire. But it will be said, 'this is giving more than one for 30,000.'
True; but has it not been just said, that the one for 30,000 is prescribed
only to fix the aggregate number, and that we are not to mind it when we
come to apportion them among the states; that for this we must recur to the
former rule, which distributes them according to the numbers in each state?
Besides, does not the bill itself, apportion among seven of the state, by
the ratio of 27,770, which is much more than one for 30,000? "Where a phrase is susceptible of two meanings, we ought certainly to
adopt that which will bring upon us the fewest inconveniences.  Let us
weigh those resulting from both constructions. "From that giving to each state a member for every 30,000 in that state,
results the single inconvenience, that there may be large fractions
unrepresented.  But it being a mere hazard on which states this will fall,
hazard will equalize it in the long run. "From the other, results exactly the same inconvenience.  A thousand cases
may be imagined to prove it  Take one; suppose eight of the states had
45,000 inhabitants each, and the other seven 44,999 each, that is to say,
each one less than each of the others, the aggregate would be 674,993, and
the number of representatives, at one for 30,000 of the aggregate, would be
22.  Then, after giving one member to each state, distribute the seven
residuary members among the seven highest fractions; and, though the
difference of population be only an unit, the representation would be the
double.  Here a single inhabitant the more would count as 30,000.  Nor is
this case imaginable only; it will resemble the real one, whenever the
fractions happen to be pretty equal through the whole states.  The numbers
of our census happen, by accident, to give the fractions all very small or
very great, so as to produce the strongest case of inequality that could
possibly have occurred, and which may newer occur again.  The probability
is, that the fractions will generally descend gradually from 39,999 to 1.
The inconvenience, then, of large unrepresented fractions attends both
constructions; and,
while the most obvious construction is liable to no other, that of the bill
incurs many and grievous ones.

"1. If you permit the large fraction in one state to choose a
representative for one of the small fractions in another state, you take
from the latter its election, which constitutes real representation, and
substitute a virtual representation of the disfranchised fractions; and the
tendency of the doctrine of virtual representation has been too well
discussed and appreciated by reasoning and resistance, on a former great
occasion, to need development now.
   
"2. The bill does not say, that it has given the residuary representatives to
the greatest fractions; though, in fact, it has done so.  It seems to have
avoided establishing that into a rule, lest it might not suit on another
occasion.  Perhaps it may be found the next time more convenient to distribute
them among, the smaller states; at another time among the larger states; at
other times. according to any other crotchet, which ingenuity may invent, and
the combination of the day give strength to carry; or they may do it
arbitrarily, by open bargain and cabal.  In short, tiffs construction
introduces into congress a scramble, or a vendue for the surplus members.  It
generates waste of time, hot blood, and may, at some time, when the passions
are high, extend a disagreement between the two houses, to the perpetual loss
of the thing, as happens
now In Pennsylvania assembly: whereas the other construction reduces the
apportionment always to an arithmetical operation, about which no two men
can possibly differ. "3. It leaves in full force the violation of the precept which declares,
that representatives shall be apportioned among the states according to
their numbers, that is, by some common ratio. "Viewing this hill either as a violation of the constitution, or as giving
an inconvenient exposition to its words, is it a case wherein the president
ought to interpose his negative?  I think it is. "1. The non-user of his negative begins. already to excite a belief, that
no president will ever venture to use it; and, consequently, has begotten a
desire to raise up barriers in the state legislatures against congress
throwing off the control of the constitution. "2. It can ever be used more pleasingly to the public, than in the
protection of the constitution. "3. No invasions of the constitution are so fundamentally dangerous, as
the tricks played on their own numbers, apportionment, and other
circumstances respecting themselves, and affecting their legal
qualifications to legislate. for the Union. "4. The majorities, by which this bill has been carried, (to wit, of one
in the senate, and two in the house of representatives,) show how divided
the opinions were there. "5. The whole of both houses admit the constitution will bear the other
exposition; whereas the minorities in both deny it will hear that of the
bill. "6. The application of any one ratio is intelligible to the people, and
will, therefore, be approved; whereas the complex operations of this bill
will never be comprehended by them; awl, though they may acquiesce, they
cannot approve, what they do not understand." Mr. Webster's report on the same subject, in the senate in April, 1832,
presents the leading arguments on the other side. "This bill, like all laws on the same subject, must be regarded, as of an
interesting and delicate nature.  It respects the distribution of political
power among the states of the Union.  It is to determine the number of
voices, which, for ten years to come, each state is to possess in the
popular branch of the legislature.  In the opinion of the committee, there
can be few or no questions, which it is more desirable should be settled on
just, fair, and satisfactory principles, than this; and, availing
themselves of the benefit of the discussion, which the bill has already
undergone in the senate, they have given to it a renewed and anxious
consideration. The result is, that, in their opinion, the bill ought to be  amended.  Seeing the difficulties, which belong to the whole subject, they
are fully convinced, that the hill has been framed and passed in the other
house, with the sincerest desire to overcome those difficulties, and to
enact a law, which should do as much justice as possible to all the states.
But the committee are constrained to say, that this object appears to them
not to have been obtained.  The unequal operation of the bill on some of
the states, should it become a law, seems to the committee most manifest;
and they cannot but express a doubt, whether its actual apportionment of
the representative power among the several states can be considered, as
conformable to the spirit of the constitution. The bill provides, that,
from and after the third of March, 1833, the house of representatives shall
be composed of members, elected agreeably to a ratio of one representative
for every forty-seven thousand and seven hundred persons in each state,
computed according to the rule prescribed by the constitution.  The
addition of the seven hundred to the forty-seven thousand, in the
composition of this ratio, produces no effect whatever in regard to the
constitution of the house.  It neither adds to, nor takes from, the number
of members assigned to any state. Its only effect is, a reduction of the
apparent amount of the fractions, as they are usually called, or residuary
numbers, alter the application of the ratio. For all other purposes, the
result is precisely the same, as if the ratio had been 47,000. "As it seems generally admitted, that inequalities do exist in this bill,
and that injurious consequences will arise from its operation, which it
would be desirable to avert, if any proper means of averting them, without
producing others equally injurious, could be found, the committee do not
think it necessary to go into a full and particular statement of these
consequences.  They will content themselves with presenting a few examples
only of these results, and such as they find it most difficult to reconcile
with justice, and the spirit of the constitution. "In exhibiting, these examples, the committee must necessarily speak of
particular states; but it is hardly necessary to say, that they speak of
them as examples only, and with the most perfect respect, not only for the
states themselves, but for all those, who represent them here. "Although the bill does not commence by fixing the whole number of the
proposed house of representatives, yet the process adopted by it brings out
the number of two hundred and forty members.  Of these two hundred and
forty members, forty are assigned to the state of NewYork, that is to say,
precisely one sixth part of the whole.  This assignment would seem to
require, that New-York should contain one sixth part of the whole
population of the United States; and would be bound  to pay one sixth part of all her direct taxes.  Yet neither of these is the
case.  The whole representative population of the United Stares is
11,929,005; that of New-York is 1,918,623, which is less than one sixth of
the whole, by nearly 70,000.  Of a direct tax of two hundred and forty
thousand dollars, New-York would pay only $38.59.  But if, instead of
comparing the numbers assigned to New-York with the whole numbers of the
house, we compare her with other states, the inequality is still more
evident and striking. "To the state of Vermont, the bill assigns five members.  It gives,
therefore, eight times as many representatives to New-York, as to Vermont;
but the population of New-York is not equal to eight times the population
of Vermont, by more than three hundred thousand.  Vermont has five members
only for 280,657 persons.  If the same proportion were to be applied to
New-York, it would reduce the number of her members from forty to
thirty-four --- making a difference more than equal to the whole
representation of Vermont, and more than sufficient to overcome her whole
power in the house of representatives. "A disproportion, almost equally striking, is manifested, if we compare
New-York with Alabama.  The population of Alabama is 262,208; for this, she
is allowed five members.  The rule of proportion, which gives to her but
five members for her number, would give to New-York but thirty-six for her
number.  Yet New-York receives forty.  As compared with Alabama, then,
New-York has an excess of representation equal to four fifths of the whole
representation of Alabama; and this excess itself will give her, of course,
as much weight in the house, as the whole delegation of Alabama, within a
single vote.  Can it be said, then, that representatives are apportioned to
these states according to their respective numbers? "The ratio assumed by the bill, it will be perceived, leaves large
fractions, so called, or residuary numbers, in several of the small states,
to the manifest loss of a part of their just proportion of representative
power.  Such is the operation of the ratio, in this respect, that NewYork,
with a population less than that of New-England by thirty or thirty-five
thousand, has yet two more members, than all the New-England states; and
there are seven states in the Union, whose members amount to the number of
123, being a clear majority of the whole house, whose aggregate fractions
altogether amount only to fifty-three thousand; while Vermont and
New-Jersey, having together but eleven members, have a joint fraction of
seventy-five thousand. "Pennsylvania by the bill will have, as it happens, just as many members
as Vermont, New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New-Jersey;  but her population is not equal to theirs by a hundred and thirty thousand;
and the reason of this advantage, derived to her from the provisions of the
bill, is, that her fraction, or residuum, is twelve thousand only, while
theirs is a hundred and forty-four. "But the subject is capable of being presented in a more exact and
mathematical form. The house is to consist of two hundred and forty
members.  Now the precise proportion of power, out of the whole mass
represented by the numbers two hundred and forty, which New-York would be
entitled to according to her population, is 38.59; that is to say, she
would be entitled to thirty-eight members, and would have a residuum, or
fraction; and, even if a member were given her for that fraction, she would
still have but thirty-nine; but the bill gives her forty. "These are a part, and but a part, of those results produced by the bill
in its present form, which the committee cannot bring themselves to
approve.  While it is not to be denied, that, under any rule of
apportionment, some degree of relative inequality must always exist, the
committee cannot believe, that the senate will sanction inequality and
injustice to the extent, in which they exist in this bill, if they can be
avoided.  But recollecting the opinions, which had been expressed in the
discussions of the senate, the committee have diligently sought to learn,
whether there was not some other number, which might be taken for a ratio,
the application of which would work out more justice sad equality.  In this
pursuit the committee have not been successful. There are, it is true,
other numbers, the adoption of which would relieve many of the states,
which suffer under the present; but this relief would be obtained only by
shifting the pressure on to other States, thus creating new grounds of
complaint in other quarters. The number forty-four thousand has been
generally spoken of, as the most acceptable substitute for forty-seven
thousand seven hundred; but should this be adopted, great relative
inequality would fall on several states, and, among them, on some of the
new and growing states, whose relative disproportion, thus already great,
would be constantly increasing.  The committee, therefore, are of opinion,
that the bill should be altered in the mode of apportionment.  They think,
that the process, which begins by assuming a ratio, should be abandoned,
and that the bill ought to be framed on the principle of the amendment,
which has been the main subject of discussion before the senate.  The
fairness of the principle of this amendment, and the general equity of its
results, compared with those, which flow from the other process, seem plain
and undeniable.  The main question has been, whether the principle itself
be constitutional; and this question the committee proceeded to exam-  ine, respectfully asking of those, who have doubted its constitutional
propriety, to deem the question of so much importance, as to justify a
second reflection. "The words of the constitution are, 'representatives and direct taxes
shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included within
this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be
determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those
bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians, three fifths
of all other persons.  The actual enumeration shall be made within three
years after the first meeting of the congress of the United States, and
within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner, as they shall by
law direct.  The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative.' "There would seem to be little difficulty in understanding these
provisions.  The terms used are designed, doubtless, to be received in no
peculiar or technical sense, but according to their common and popular
acceptation.  To apportion, is to distribute by right measure; to set off
in just parts; to assign in due and proper proportion.  These clauses of
the constitution respect, not only the portions of power, but the portions
of the public burden, also, which should fall to the several states; and
the same language is applied to both. 'Representatives are to be
apportioned among the states according to their respective numbers, and
direct taxes are to be apportioned by the same rule.  The end aimed at is,
that representation and taxation should go hand in hand; that each state
should be represented in the same extent, to which it is made subject to
the public charges by direct taxation.  But, between tim apportionment of
representatives and the apportionment of taxes there necessarily exists one
essential difference.  Representation, founded on numbers, must have some
limit; and being, from its nature, a thing not capable of indefinite
subdivision, it cannot be made precisely equal.  A tax, indeed, cannot
always, or often be apportioned with perfect exactness; as, in other
matters of account there will be fractional parts of the smallest coins,
and the smallest denomination of money of account, yet, by the usual
subdivisions of the coin, and of tim denomination of money, the
apportionment of taxes is capable of being made so exact, that tire
inequality becomes minute and invisible.  But representation cannot be thus
divided.  Of representation, there can be nothing less than one
representative; nor by our constitution, more representatives than one for
every thirty thousand.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that tim
apportionment of representative power can never be precise anti  perfect. There must always exist some degree of inequality. Those, who
framed, and those, who adopted the constitution, were, of course, fully
acquainted with this necessary operation of the provision. In the senate,
the states are entitled to a fixed number of senators; and, therefore, in
regard to their representation, in that body, there is no consequential or
incidental inequality arising.  But, being represented in the house of
representatives according to their respective numbers of people, it is
unavoidable, that, in assigning to each, state its number of members, the
exact proportion of each, out of a given number, cannot always or often be
expressed in whole numbers; that is to say, it will not often be found,
that there belongs to a state exactly one tenth, or one twentieth, or one
thirtieth of the whole house; and, therefore, no number of representatives
will exactly correspond with the right of such state, or the precise share
of representation, which belongs to it, according to its population. "The constitution, therefore, must be understood, not as enjoining an
absolute relative equality -- because that would be demanding an
impossibility -- but as requiring of congress to make the apportionment of
representatives among the several states, according to their respective
numbers, as near as may be.  That, which cannot be done perfectly, must be
done in a manner as near perfection, as can be.  If exactness cannot, from
the nature of things, be attained, then the greatest practicable approach
to exactness ought to be made. "Congress is not absolved from all rule, merely because the rule of
perfect justice cannot be applied.  In such a case, approximation becomes a
rule; it takes the place of that other tale. which would be preferable, but
which is found inapplicable, and becomes, itself, an obligation of binding
force.  The nearest approximation to exact truth, or exact right. when that
exact truth, or that exact right cannot itself be reached, prevails in
other cases, not as matter of discretion, but as an intelligible and
definite rule, dictated by justice, and conforming to the common sense of
mankind; a rule of no less binding force in cases, to which it is
applicable, and no more to be departed from, than any other rule or
obligation. "The committee understand the constitution, as they would have understood
it, if it had said, in so many words, that representatives should be
apportioned among the states, according to their respective numbers, as
near as may be.  If this be not its true meaning, then it has either given.
on this most delicate and important subject, a rule, which is always
impracticable, or else it has given no rule at all; because, if the rule
be, that representatives shall be apportioned exactly according  to numbers, it is impracticable in every case; and if, for this reason,
that cannot be the rule, then there is no rule whatever, unless the rule
be, that they shall be apportioned, as near as may be. "This construction, indeed, which the committee adopt, has not, to [heir
knowledge, been denied; and they proceed in the discussion of the question
before the senate, taking for granted, that such is the true and undeniable
meaning of the.constitution. "The next thing to be observed is, that the constitution prescribes no
particular process, by which this apportionment is to be wrought out. It
has plainly described the end to be accomplished, viz. the nearest approach
to relative equality of representation among the states; and whatever
accomplishes this end, and nothing else, is the true process. In-truth, if,
without any process whatever, whether elaborate or easy, congress could
perceive the exact proportion of representative power rightfully belonging
to each state, it would perfectly fulfil its duty by conferring that
portion on each, without reference to any process whatever.  It would be
enough, that the proper end had been attained. And it is to be remarked
further, that, whether this end be attained best by one process or by
another, it becomes, when each process has been carried through, not matter
of opinion, but matter of mathematical certainty.  If the whole population
of the United States, the population of each state, and the proposed number
of the house of representatives, be all given, then, between two bills
apportioning the members among the several states, it can be told, with
absolute certainty, which bill assigns to any and every state the number
nearest to the exact proportion of that state; in other words, which of the
two hills, if either, apportions the representatives according to the
number of the states, respectively, as near as may be.  If, therefore, a
particular process of apportionment be adopted, and objection be made to
the injustice or inequality of its result, it is, surely, no answer to such
objection to say, that the inequality necessarily results from the nature
of the process.  Before such answer could avail, it would be necessary to
show, either that the constitution prescribes such process, and makes it
necessary, or that there is no other mode of proceeding, which would
produce less inequality and less injustice.  If inequality, which might
have otherwise been avoided, be produced by a given process, then that
process is a wrong one.  It is not suited to the case, and should be
rejected. "Nor do the committee perceive how it can be matter of constitutional
propriety or validity, or in any way a constitutional question, whether the
process, which may be applied to the case, be simple or compound, one
process or many processes; since, in the end, it may  always be seen, whether the result be that, which has been aimed at,
namely, the nearest practicable approach to precise justice and relative
inequality.  The committee, indeed, are of opinion, in this case, that the
simplest, and most obvious way of proceeding, is also the true and
constitutional way.  To them it appears, that in carrying into effect this
part of the constitution, the first thing naturally to be done is, to
decide on the whole number, of which the house is to be composed; as when,
under the same clause of the constitution, a tax is to be apportioned among
the states, the amount of the whole tax is, in the first place, to be
settled. "When the whole number of the proposed house is thus ascertained, and
fixed, it becomes the entire representative power of all the people in the
Union.  It is then a very simple matter to ascertain how much of this
representative power each state is entitled to by its numbers. If, for
example, the house is to contain 240 members, then the number 240 expresses
the representative power of all the states; and a plain calculation readily
shows how much of this power belongs to each state. This portion, it is
true, will not always, nor often, be expressed in whole numbers, but it may
always be precisely exhibited by a decimal form of expression. If the
portion of any state be seldom, or never, one exact tenth, one exact
fifteenth, or one exact twentieth, it will still always, be capable of
precise decimal expression, as one tenth and two hundredths, one twelfth
and four hundredths, one fifteenth and six hundredths, and so on; and the
exact portion of the state, being thus decimally expressed, will always
show, to mathematical certainty, what integral number comes nearest to such
exact portion.  For example, in a house consisting of two hundred and forty
members, the exact mathematical proportion, to which her numbers entitle
the state of NewYork, is 38.5 9; it is certain, therefore, that thirty-nine
is the integral or whole number, nearest to her exact proportion of the
representative power of the Union.  Why, then, should she not have
thirty-nine? and why should she have forty? She is not quite entitled to
thirty-nine; that number is something more than her right. But, allowing
her thirtynine, from the necessity of giving her whole numbers, and because
that is the nearest whole number, is not the constitution fully obeyed,
when she has received the thirty-ninth number?  Is not her proper number of
representatives then apportioned to her, as near as may be? And is not the
constitution disregarded, when the bill goes further, and gives
her a fortieth member?  For what is such a fortieth member given? Not for
her absolute numbers; for her absolute numbers do not entitle her to
thirty-nine.  Not for the sake of apportioning her members to her numbers,
as near as tony be, because thirty-nine is a nearer apportionment of
members to numbers than forty.  But it is given, say the advocates of the
bill, because the process, which has been adopted, gives it.  The answer
is, no such process is enjoined by the constitution. "The case of New York may be compared or contrasted with that of Missouri.
The exact proportion of Missouri, in a general representation of two
hundred sad forty, is two and six tenths; that is to say, it comes nearer
to three members, than to two, yet it is confined to two. But why is not
Missouri entitled to that number of representatives, which comes nearest to
her exact proportion?  Is the constitution fulfilled as to her, while that
number is withheld, and while, at the same time, in another state, not only
is that nearest number given, but an additional member given also?  Is it
an answer, with which the people of Missouri ought to be satisfied, when it
is said, that this obvious injustice is the necessary result of the process
adopted by the bill?  May they not say, with propriety, that since three is
the nearest whole number to their exact right, to that number they are
entitled, and the process, which deprives them of it, must be a wrong
process?  A similar comparison might be made between New-York and Vermont.
The exact proportion, to which Vermont is entitled, in a representation of
two hundred and forty, is 5.646.  Her nearest whole number, therefore,
would be six.  Now, two things are undeniably true: first, that to take
away the fortieth member from New-York would bring her representation
nearer to her exact proportion, than it stands by leaving her that fortieth
member.  Secondly, that giving the member, thus taken from New-York, to
Vermont, would bring her representation nearer to her exact right, than it
is by the bill.  And both these propositions are equally. true of a
transfer of the twenty-eighth member assigned by the bill to Pennsylvania,
to Delaware, and of the thirteenth member assigned to Kentucky, to
Missouri; in other words, Vermont has, by her numbers, more right to six
members, than New-York has to forty. Delaware, by her numbers, has more
right to two members, than Pennsylvania has to twenty-eight; and Missouri,
by her numbers, has more right to three members, than Kentucky has to
thirteen.  Without disturbing the proposed number of the house, the mere
changing of these three members, from and to the six states respectively,
would
bring the representation of each of the whole six nearer to their due
proportion, according to their respective numbers, than the bill,'in its
present form makes it.  In the face of this indisputable truth, how can it
be said, that the bill apportions these members among those states,
according to their respective number, at near as may be? "The principle, on which the proposed amendment is founded, is an
effectual corrective for these, and all other equally great inequalities.
It may be applied, at all times, and in all cases, and its result will
always be the nearest approach to perfect justice.  It is equally simple
and impartial. As a rule of apportionment, it is little other than a transcr
ipt of the words of the constitution, and its results are mathematically
certain. The constitution, as the committee understand it, says,
representatives shall be apportioned among the states, according to their
respective numbers of people, as near as may be.  The rule adopted by the
committee says, out of the whole number of the house, that number shall be
apportioned to each state, which comes nearest to its exact right,
according to its number of people. "Where is the repugnancy between the constitution and the rule? The
arguments against the rule seem to assume, that there is a necessity of
instituting some process adopting some number as the ratio, or as that
number of people, which each member shall be understood to represent; but
the committee see no occasion for any other process whatever, than simply
the ascertainment of that quantum, out of the whole mass of the
representative power, which each state may claim. "But it is said, that, although a state may receive a number of
representatives, which is something less than its exact proportion of
representation, yet, that it can, in no case, constitutionally receive
more. How is this proposition proved?  How is it shown, that the
constitution is less perfectly fulfilled by allowing a state a small
excess, than by subjecting her to a large deficiency?  What the
constitution requires, is the nearest practicable approach to precise
justice.  The rule is approximation; and we ought to approach, therefore,
on whichever. side we can approach nearest. "But there is still a more conclusive answer to be given to this
suggestion.  The whole number of representatives, of which the house is to
be composed, is, of necessity, limited.  This number, whatever it is, is
that which is to be apportioned, and nothing else can be apportioned.  This
is the whole sum to be distributed.  If, therefore, in making the
apportionment, some state receive less than their just share, it must
necessarily follow, that some other states have received more than their  just share. If there be one state in the Union with less than its right,
some other state has more than its right, so.that the argument, whatever be
its force, applies to the hill in its present form, as strongly as it can
ever apply to any bill. "But the objection most usually urged against the principle of the
proposed amendment is, that it provides for the representation of
fractions. Let this objection be examined and considered. Let it be
ascertained, in the first place, what these fractions, or fractional
numbers, or residuary numbers, really are, which, it is said, will be
represented, should the amendment prevail. "A fraction is the broken part of some integral number.  It is, therefore,
a relative or derivative idea.  It implies the previous existence of some
fixed number, of which it is lint a part, or remainder.  If there be no
necessity for fixing or establishing such previous number, then the
fraction, resulting from it, is itself no matter of necessity, but matter
of choice or of accident.  Now the argument, which considers the plan
proposed in the amendment, as a representation of fractions, and therefore
unconstitutional, assumes, as its basis, that, according to the
constitution, every member of the house of representatives represents, or
ought to represent, the same, or nearly the same, number of constituents:
that this number is to be regarded, as an integer; and any thing less than
this is, therefore, called n fraction, or a residuum, and cannot be
entitled to a representative.  But all this is not the provision of the
constitution of the United States.  That constitution contemplates no
integer, or any common number for the constituents of a member of the house
of representatives. It goes not at all into these subdivisions of the
population of a state.  It provides for the apportionment of
representatives among the several states, according to their respective
numbers, and stops there.  It makes no provision for the representation of
districts, of states, or for the representation of any portion or the
people of a state, less than the whole.  It says nothing of ratios or of
constituent numbers.  All these things it leaves to state legislation. The
right, which each state possesses to its own due portion of the
representative power, is a state right, strictly; it belongs to the state,
as a state; and it is to be used and exercised, as the state may see fit,
subject only to the constitutional qualifications of electors.  In fact,
the states do make, and always have made, different provisions for the
exercise of this power.  In some, a single member is chosen for a certain
defined district; in others, two or three members are chosen
for the same district; and, in some again, as New-Hampshire, RhodeIsland,
Connecticut, New-Jersey, and Georgia, the whole representation of the state
is exerted, as a joint, undivided representation. In these last-mentioned
states, every member of the house of representatives has for his
constituents all the people of the state; and all the people of those
states are consequently represented in that branch of congress. If the bill
before the senate should pass into a law, in its present form, whatever
injustice it might do to any of those states, it would not be correct to
say of them, nevertheless, that any portion of their people was
unrepresented.  The well-founded objection would be, as to some of them at
least, that they were not adequately, competently, fairly represented; that
they had not as many voices and as many votes in the house of
representatives, as they were entitled to. This would be the objection.
There would be no unrepresented fractions; but the state, as a state, as a
whole would be deprived of some part of its just rights. "On the other hand, if the bill should pass, as it is now proposed to be
amended, there would be no representation of fractions in any state; for a
fraction supposes a division and a remainder.  All, that could justly be
said, would be, that some of these states, as states, possessed a portion
of legislative power, a little larger than their exact right; as it must be
admitted, that, should the bill pass unamended, they would posses, of that
power, much less than that exact right. The same remarks are substantially
true, if applied to those states, which adopt the district system, as most
of them do.  In Missouri, for example, there will be no fraction
unrepresented, should the bill become a law in its present form; nor any
member for a fraction, should the amendment prevail; because the mode of
apportionment, which assigns to each state that number, which is nearest to
its exact right, applies no assumed ratios, makes no subdivisions, and, of
course, produces no fractions. In the one case, or in the other, the state,
as a state, will have something more, or something less, than its exact
proportion of representative power; but she will part out this power among
her own people, in either case, in such mode, as she may choose, or
exercise it altogether, as an entire representation of the people of the
state. "Whether the subdivision of the representative power within any state, if
there be a subdivision, be equal or unequal, or fairly or unfairly made,
congress cannot know, and has no authority to inquire. It is enough, that
the state presents her own representation on the floor of congress in the
mode she chooses to present it. If a state were to give  to one portion of her territory a representative for every twenty-five
thousand persons, and to the rest a representative only for every fifty
thousand, it would be an act of unjust legislation, doubtless, but it would
be wholly beyond redress by any power in congress; because the constitution
has left all this to the state itself. "These considerations, it is thought, may show, that the constitution has
not, by any implication, or necessary construction, enjoined that, which it
certainly has not ordained in terms, viz. that every member of the house
shall be supposed to represent the same number of constituents; and
therefore, that the assumption of a ratio, as representing the common
number of constituents, is not called for by the constitution. All that
congress is at liberty to do, as it would seem, is to divide the whole
representative power of the Union into twenty-four parts, assigning one
part to each state, as near as practicable, according to its right, and
leaving all subsequent arrangement, and all subdivisions, to the state
itself. "If the view thus taken of the rights of the states, and the duties of
congress, be the correct view, then the plan proposed in the amendment is,
in no just sense, a representation of fractions.  But suppose it was
otherwise; suppose a direct division were made for allowing a
representative to every state, in whose population, it being first divided
by a Common ratio, there should be found a fraction exceeding half the
amount, of that ratio, what constitutional objection could be fairly urged
against such a provision?   Let it be always remembered, that the case here
supposed provides only for a fraction exceeding the moiety of the ratio;
for the committee admit, at once, that the representation of fractions,
less than a moiety, is unconstitutional; because, should a member be
allowed to a state for such a fraction, it would be certain, that her
representation would not be so near her exact right, as it was before.  But
the allowance of n member for a major fraction is a direct approximation
towards justice and quality.  There appears to the committee to be nothing,
either in the letter or the spirit of the constitution, opposed to such a
mode of apportionment.  On the contrary, it seems entirely consistent with
the very object, which the constitution contemplated, and well calculated
to accomplish it. The argument commonly urged against it is, that it is
necessary to apply some one common divisor, and to abide by its results. "If, by this, it be meant, that there must be some common rule, or common
measure, applicable, and applied impartially to all the states, it is quite
true. But, if that which is intended, be, that the population of each  state must be divided by a fixed ratio, and all resulting fractions, great
or small, disregarded, this is but to take for granted the very thing in
controversy.  The question is, whether it be unconstitutional to make
approximation to equality, by allowing representatives for major fractions.
The affirmative of this question is, indeed, denied; but iris not
disproved, by saying, that we must abide by the operation of division, by
an assumed ratio, and disregard fractions.  The question still remains, as
it was before; anti it is still to be shown, what there is in the
constitution, which rejects approximation, as the rule of apportionment.
But suppose it to be necessary to find a divisor, and to abide its results.
What is a divisor?  Not necessarily a simple number.  It may be composed of
a whole number and a fraction; it may itself be the result of a previous
process; it may be any thing, in short, which produces accurate and uniform
division: whatever does this, is a common rule, a common standard, or, if
the word be important, a common divisor.  The committee refer, on this part
of the case, to some observations by Professor Dean, with a table, both of
which accompany this report. "As it is not improbable, that opinion has been a good deal influenced on
this subject by what took place on the passing of the first act, making an
apportionment of representatives among the states, the committee have
examined and considered that precedent.  If it be in point to the present
case, it is certainly entitled to very great weight; but if it be of
questionable application, the text of the constitution, even if it were
doubtful, could not be explained by a doubtful commentary. In the opinion
of the committee, it is only necessary, that what was said on that occasion
should be understood in connexion with the subject-matter then under
consideration; and, in order to see what that subjectmatter really was, the
committee think it necessary to state, shortly, the case. "The two houses of congress passed a bill, after the first enumeration of
the people, providing for a house of representatives, which should consist
of one hundred and twenty members.  The bill expressed no rule or
principle, by which these members were assigned to the several states.  It
merely said, that New-Hampshire should have five members, Massachusetts
ten, and so on; going through all the states, and assigning the whole
number of one hundred and twenty.  Now, by the census, then recently taken,
it appeared, that the whole representative population of the United States
was 3,615,920; and it was evidently the wish of congress to make the house
as numerous, as the constitution would allow.  But the constitution has
said, that there should not be  more than one member for every thirty thousand persons.  This prohibition
was, of course, to be obeyed; but did the constitution mean, that no states
should have more than one member for every thirty thousand persons? or did
it only mean, that the whole house, as compared with the whole population
of the United States, should not contain more than one member for every
thirty thousand persons?  If this last were the true construction, then the
bill, in that particular, was right; if the first were the true
construction, then it was wrong; because so many members could not be
assigned to the states, without giving to some o! them more members than
one for every thirty thousand.  In fact, the bill did propose to do this in
regard to several states. "President Washington adopted that construction of the constitution, which
applied its prohibition to each state individually.  He thought, that no
state could, constitutionally, receive more than one member for every
thirty thousand of her own population.  On this, therefore, his main
objection to the bill was founded. That objection he states in these words: "The constitution has also provided, that the number of representatives
shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand; which restriction is, by
the context, and by fair and obvious construction, to be applied to the
separate and respective numbers of the states; and the bill has allotted to
eight of the states more than one for every thirty thousand.' "It is now necessary to see what there was further objectionable in this
bill.  The number of one hundred and twelve members was all that could be
divided among the states, without giving to some of them more than one
member fur thirty thousand inhabitants.  Therefore, having allotted these
one hundred and twelve, there still remained eight of the one hundred and
twenty to be assigned; and these eight the bill assigned to the states
having the largest fractions.  Some of these fractions were large, and some
were small.  No regard was paid to fractions over a moiety of the ratio,
any more than to fractions under it. There was no rule laid down, stating
what fractions should entitle the states, to whom they might happen to
fall, or in whose population they might happen to be found, to a
representative therefor.  The assignment was net made on the principle,
that each state should have a member for a fraction greater than half the
ratio; or that all the states should have a member for a fraction, in all
cases where the allowance of such member would bring her representation
nearer to its exact proportion than its disallowance. There was no common
measure, or common  rule, adopted, but the assignment was matter of arbitrary discretion. A
member was allowed to New-Hampshire for example, for a fraction of less
than one half the ratio, thus placing her representation further from her
exact proportion, than it was without such additional member; while a
member was refused to Georgia, whose case closely resembled that of
New-Hampshire, both having what were thought large fractions, but both
still under a moiety of the ratio, and distinguished from each other only
by a very slight difference of absolute numbers. The committee have already
fully expressed their opinion on such a mode of apportionment. "In regard to this character of the bill. President Washington said: 'The
constitution has prescribed, that representatives shall be apportioned
among the several states according to their respective numbers; and there
is no one proportion, or divisor, which, applied to the respective numbers
of the states, will yield the number and allotment of representatives
proposed by the bill.' "This was all undoubtedly true, and was, in the judgment of the committee,
a decisive objection against the bill. It is nevertheless to be observed,
that the other objection completely covered the whole ground. There could,
in that bill, be no allowance for a fraction, great or small; because
congress had taken for the ratio the lowest number allowed by the
constitution, viz. thirty thousand.  Whatever fraction a state might have
less than that ratio, no member could be allowed for it.  It is scarcely
necessary to observe, that no such objection applies to the amendment now
proposed.  No state should the amendment prevail, will have a greater
number of members than one for every thirty thousand; nor is it likely,
that that objection will ever again occur. The whole force of the
precedent, whatever it be, in its application to the present case is drawn
from the other objection.  And what is the true import of that objection?
Does it mean any thing more than, that the apportionment was not made on a
common rule or principle, applicable, and applied alike to all the states? "President Washington's words are, 'there is no one proportion or divisor,
which, applied to the respective numbers of the states, will yield the
number and allotment of representatives proposed by the bill.' "If, then, he could have found a common proportion, it would have removed
this objection. He required a proportion or divisor.  These
words he evidently uses, as explanatory of each other.  He meant by
divisor, therefore, no more than by proportion.  What he sought was, some
common and equal rule, by which the allotment had been made among the
several states; he did not find such common rule; and on that ground, he
thought the bill objectionable. "In the opinion of the committee, no such objection applies to the
amendment recommended by them.  That amendment gives a rule, plain, simple,
just, uniform, and of universal application. The rule has been frequently
stated.  It may be clearly expressed in either of two ways.  Let the rule
be, that the whole number of the proposed house shall be apportioned among
the several states according to their respective numbers, giving to each
state that number of members, which comes nearest to her exact mathematical
part or proportion; or, let the rule be, that the population of each state
shall be divided by a common divisor, and that, in addition to the number
of members resulting from such division, a member shall be allowed to each
state, whose fraction exceeds a moiety of the divisor. "Either of these is it seems to the committee, a fair and just rule,
capable of uniform application, and operating with entire impartiality.
There is no want of a common proportion, or a common divisor; there is
nothing left to arbitrary discretion.  If the rule, in either of these
forms, be adopted, it can never be doubtful how every member of any
proposed number for a house of representatives ought to be assigned.
Nothing will be left in the discretion of congress; the right of each state
will be a mathematical right, easily ascertained, about which there can be
neither doubt nor difficulty; and, in the application of the rule, there
will be no room for preference, partiality, or injustice.  In any case, in
all time to come, it will do all, that human means can do, to allot to
every state in the Union its proper and just proportion of representative
power.  And it is because or this, its capability of constant application,
as well as because of its impartiality and justice, that the committee are
earnest in recommending its adoption to congress.  If it shall be adopted,
they believe it will remove a cause of uneasiness and dissatisfaction,
recurring, or liable to recur, with every new census, and place the rights
of the states, in this respect, on a fixed basis, of which none can with
reason complain.  It is true, that there may be some numbers assumed for
the composition of the house of representatives, to which, if the rule were
applied, the result might give a member to the
house more than was proposed.  But it will be always easy to correct this,
by altering the proposed number by adding one to it, or taking one from it;
so that this can be considered no objection to the rule. "The committee, in conclusion, cannot admit, that it is sufficient reason
for rejecting this mode of apportionment, that a different process has
heretofore prevailed.  The truth is, the errors and inequalities of that
process were at first not obvious and startling.  But they have gone on
increasing; they are greatly augmented and accumulated every new census;
and it is of the very nature of the process itself, that its unjust results
must grow greater and greater in proportion as the population of the
country enlarges.  What was objectionable, though tolerable yesterday,
becomes intolerable to-morrow.  A change, the committee are persuaded, must
come, or the whole just balance and proportion of representative power
among the states will be disturbed and broken up." Mr. Everett also made a very able speech on the same subject, in which he
pressed some additional arguments with great force on the same side.  See
