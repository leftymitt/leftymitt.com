  § 688.
 </b>
 The third section of the first article relates to the
organization
and powers of the senate.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 689.
 </b>
 In considering the organization of the senate, our inquiries
naturally lead us to ascertain; first, the nature of the representation and
rote of the states therein; secondly, the mode of appointment; thirdly, the
number of the senators; fourthly, their term of service; and fifthly, their
qualifications.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 690.
 </b>
 The first clause of the third section is in the
following words:
"The senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from
each state, chosen by the legislature thereof for six years; and each
senator shall hare one vote."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 691.
 </b>
 In the first place, the nature of the representation
and vote in
the senate. Each state is entitled to two senators; and each senator is
entitled to one rote. This, of course, involves in the very constitution of
this branch of the legislature a perfect equality among all the states,
without any reference to their respective size, population, wealth, or
power. In this respect there is a marked contrast between the senate and
the house of representatives. In the latter, there is a representation of
the people according to the relative population of each state upon a given
basis; in the former, each state in its political capacity is represented
upon a footing of perfect equality, like a congress of sovereigns, or
ambassadors, or like an assembly of peers. The only difference between it
and the continental congress under the old confederation is, that in this
</p>
<p>
 the vote was by states; in the senate, each senator has a single vote. So
that, though they represent states, they vote as individuals. The vote of
the senate thus may, and often does, become a mixed vote, embracing a part
of the senators from some of the states on one side, and another part on
the other.
</p>
<b>
 § 692.
</b>
It is obvious, that this arrangement could only arise from a
compromise between independent states; and it must have been less the
result of theory, than "of a spirit of amity, and of mutual deference and
concession, which the peculiarity of the situation of the United States
rendered indispensable."
<sup>
 <a href="#1">

</sup>
It constituted one of the great struggles
between the large and the small states, which was constantly renewed in the
convention, and impeded it in every step of its progress in the formation
of the constitution.
<sup>
 <a href="#2">
  2
 </a>
</sup>
The struggle applied to the organization of each
branch of the legislature. The small states insisted upon an equality of
vote and representation in each branch; and the large states upon a vote in
proportion to their relative importance and population. Upon this vital
question there was so near a balance of the states, that a union in any
form of government, which provided either for a perfect equality or
inequality of the states in both branches of the legislature, became
utterly hopeless.
<sup>
 <a href="#3">
  3
 </a>
</sup>
If the basis of the senate was an equality of
representation, the basis of the house must bein proportion to the
relative population of the states.
<sup>
 <a href="#4">
  4
 </a>
</sup>
A compromise was, therefore, in-
<p>
 dispensable, or the convention must be dissolved. The small states at
length yielded the point, as to an equality of representation in the house,
and acceded to a representation proportionate to the federal numbers. But
they insisted upon an equality in the senate. To this the large states were
unwilling to assent; and for a time the states were, on this point, equally
divided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#5">
   5
  </a>
 </sup>
 Finally, the subject was referred to a committee, who reported a
scheme, which became, with some amendments, the basis of the
representation, as it now stands.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 693.
 </b>
 The reasoning, by which each party in the convention
supported its
own project, naturally grew out of the relative situation and interests of
their respective states. On the side of the small states, it was urged,
that the general government ought to be partly federal, and partly
national, in order to secure a just balance of power and sovereignty, and
influence among the states. This is the only means to preserve small
communities, when associating with larger, from being overwhelmed, and
annihilated. The large states, under other circumstances, would naturally
pursue their own interests, and by combinations usurp the prerogatives, or
disregard the rights of the smaller. Hitherto, all the states had held a
footing of equality; and no one would now be willing to surrender it. The
course now proposed would allay jealousies, and produce tranquillity. Any
other would only perpetuate discontents, and lead to disunion. There never
was a confederacy formed, where an equality of voice was not a fundamental
principle. It would be a novel thing in politics, in such
</p>
<p>
 cases, to permit the few to control the many. The large states, upon the
present plan, have a full security. The small states must possess the power
of self-defence, or they are ruined.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 694.
 </b>
 On the other hand, it was urged, that to give an
equality of vote
to all the states, was adopting a principle of gross injustice and
inequality. It is not true, that all confederacies have been founded upon
the principle of equality. It was not so in the Lycian confederacy.
Experience has shown, that the old confederation is radically defective,
and a national government is indispensable. The present plan will defeat
that object. Suppose the first branch grants money; the other branch (the
senate) might, from mere state views, counteract it. In congress, the
single state of Delaware prevented an embargo at the time, when all the
other states thought it absolutely necessary for the support of the army.
In short, the senate will have the power by its negative of defeating all
laws. If this plan prevails, seven states will control the whole; and yet
these seven states are, in point of population and strength, less than one
third of the Union. So, that two thirds are compellable to yield to one
third. There is no danger to the small states from the combination of the
large ones. A rivalry, rather than a confederacy, will exist among them.
There can be no monarchy; and an aristocracy is more likely to arise from a
combination of the small states. There are two kinds of bad governments;
the one,which does too much, and is therefore oppressive; and the other,
which does too little, and is therefore weak. The present plan will fasten
the latter upon the country. The only reasonable principle, on which to
round a general government, is, that the decision shall be by a majority of
members,
</p>
<p>
 and not of states. No advantage can possibly be proposed by the large
states by swallowing up the smaller. The like fear existed in Scotland at
the time of the union with England; but it has turned out to be wholly
without foundation. Upon the present plan, the smaller states may swallow
up the larger. It was added by one most distinguished statesman,
 <sup>
  <a href="#7">
   7
  </a>
 </sup>
 (what
has hitherto proved prophetically too true,) that the danger was not
between the small and the large states. "The great danger to our general
government is, the great southern and northern interests of this continent
being opposed to each other. Look to the votes in congress, and most of
them stand divided by the geography of the country, not according to the
size of the states."
 <sup>
  <a href="#8">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 695.
 </b>
 Whatever may now be thought of the reasoning of the
contending
parties, no person, who possesses a sincere love of country, and wishes for
the permanent union of the states, can doubt, that the compromise actually
made was well founded in policy, and may now be fully vindicated upon the
highest principles of political wisdom, and the true nature of the
government, which was intended to be established.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 696.
 </b>
 It may not be unprofitable to review a few of the
grounds, upon
which this opinion is hazarded. In the first place, the very structure of
the general government contemplated one partly federal, and partly
national. It not only recognized the existence of the state governments;
but perpetuated them, leaving them
</p>
<p>
 in the enjoyment of a large portion of the rights of sovereignty, and
giving to the general government a few powers, and those only, which were
necessary for national purposes. The general government was, therefore,
upon the acknowledged basis, one of limited and circumscribed powers; the
states were to possess the residuary powers. Admitting, then, that it is
right, among a people thoroughly incorporated into one nation, that every
district of territory ought to have a proportional share of the government;
and that among independent states, bound together by a simple league, there
ought, on the other hand, to be an equal share in the common councils,
whatever might be their relative size or strength, (both of which
propositions are not easily controverted;) it would follow, that a compound
republic, partaking of the character of each, ought to be founded on a
mixture of proportional, and of equal representation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#9">
   9
  </a>
 </sup>
 The legislative
power being that, which is predominant in all governments, ought to be,
above all, of this character; because there can be no security for the
general government, or the state governments, without an adequate
representation, and an adequate check of each in the functions of
legislation. Whatever basis, therefore, is assumed for one branch of the
legislature, the antagonist basis should be assumed for the other. If the
house is to be proportional to the relative size, and wealth, and
population of the states, the senate should be fixed upon an absolute
equality, as the representative of state sovereignty. There is so much
reason, and justice, and security in such a course, that it can with
difficulty be overlooked by those, who sincerely consult the public good,
without
</p>
<p>
 being biassed by the interests or prejudices of their peculiar local
position. The equal vote allowed in the senate is, in this view, at once a
constitutional recognition of the sovereignty remaining in the states, and
an instrument for the preservation of it. It guards them against (what they
meant to resist, as improper) a consolidation of the states into one simple
republic;
 <sup>
  <a href="#10">
   10
  </a>
 </sup>
 and, on the other hand, the weight of the other branch
counterbalances an undue preponderance of state interests, tending to
disunion.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 697.
 </b>
 Another and most important advantage arising from this
ingredient
is, the great difference, which it creates in the elements of the two
branches of the legislature; which constitutes a great desideratum in every
practical division of the legislative power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#11">
   11
  </a>
 </sup>
 In fact, this division (as
has been already intimated) is of little or no intrinsic value, unless it
is so organized, that each can operate, as a real check upon undue and rash
legislation. If each branch is substantially framed upon the same plan, the
advantages of the division are shadowy and imaginative; the visions and
speculations of the brain, and not the walking thoughts of statesmen, or
patriots. It may be safely asserted, that for all the purposes of liberty,
and security, of state laws, and of solid institutions, of personal rights,
and of the protection of property, a single branch is quite as good, as
two, if their composition is the same, and their spirits and impulses the
same. Each will act, as the other does; and each will be led by the same
common influence of ambition, or intrigue, or passion, to the same
disregard
</p>
<p>
 of the public interests, and the same indifference to, and prostration of
private rights. It will only be a duplication of the evils of oppression
and rashness, with a duplication of obstructions to effective redress. In
this view, the organization of the senate becomes of inestimable value. It
represents the voice, not of a district, but of a state; not of one state,
but of all; not of the interest of one state, but of all not of the chosen
pursuits of a predominant population in one state, but of all the pursuits
in all the states.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 698.
 </b>
 It is a misfortune incident to republican governments,
though in a
less degree than to other governments, that those, who administer it, may
forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to
their trusts. In this point of view, a senate, as a second branch of
legislative power, distinct from, and dividing, power with the first; must
always operate as a salutary check. It doubles the security to the people,
by requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in any scheme of
usurpation or perfidy, where otherwise the ambition of a single body would
be sufficient. The improbability of sinister combinations will always be in
proportion to the dissimilarity of the genius of the two bodies; and
therefore every circumstance, consistent with harmony in all proper
measures, which points out a distinct organization of the component
materials of each, is desirable.
 <sup>
  <a href="#12">
   12
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 699.
 </b>
 No system could, in this respect, be more admirably
contrived to
ensure due deliberation and inquiry, and just results in all matters of
legislation. No law or resolution can be passed without the concurrence,
first of a majority of the people, and then of
</p>
<p>
 a majority of the states. The interest, and passions, and prejudices of a
district are thus checked by the influence of a whole state; the like
interests, and passions, and prejudices of a state, or of a majority of the
states, are met and controlled by the voice of the people of the nation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">
   13
  </a>
 </sup>
 It may be thought, that this complicated system of checks may operate, in
some instances, injuriously, as well as beneficially. But if it should
occasionally work inequally, or injuriously, its general operation will be
salutary and useful.
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 The disease most incident to free governments is
the facility and excess of law-making;
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
 and while it never can be the
permanent interest of either branch to interpose any undue restraint upon
the exercise of all fit legislation, a good law had better occasionally
fail, rather than bad laws be multiplied with a heedless and mischievous
frequency. Even reforms, to be safe, must, in general, be slow; and there
can be little danger, that public opinion will not sufficiently stimulate
all public bodies to changes, which are at once desirable, and politic. All
experience proves, that the human mind is more eager and restless for
changes, than tranquil and satisfied with existing institutions. Besides;
the large states will always be able, by their power over the supplies, to
defeat any unreasonable exertions of this prerogative by the smaller
states.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 700.
 </b>
 This reasoning, which theoretically seems entitled to great weight,
has, in the progress of the government, been fully realized. It has not
only been demonstrated, that the senate, in its actual or-
</p>
<p>
 ganization, is well adopted to the exigencies of the nation; but that it is
a most important and valuable part of the system, and the real
balance-wheel, which adjusts, and regulates its movements.
 <sup>
  <a href="#16">
   16
  </a>
 </sup>
 The other
auxiliary provisions in the same clause, as to the mode of appointment and
duration of office, will be found to conduce very largely to the same
beneficial end.
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">
   17
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 701.
 </b>
 Secondly; the mode of appointment of the senators. They
are to be
chosen by the legislature of each state. Three schemes presented
themselves, as to the mode of appointment; one was by the legislature of
each state; another was by the people thereof; and a third was by the other
branch of the national legislature, either directly, or out of a select
nomination. The last scheme was proposed in the convention, in what was
called the Virginia scheme, one of the resolutions, declaring, "that the
members of the second branch (the senate) ought to be elected by those of
the first (the house of representatives) out of a proper number nominated
by the individual legislatures" (of the states.) It met, however, with no
decided support, and was negatived, no state voting in its favour, nine
states voting against it, and one being divided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">
   18
  </a>
 </sup>
 The second scheme, of
an election by the people in districts, or otherwise, seems to have met
with as little favour.
 <sup>
  <a href="#19">
   19
  </a>
 </sup>
 The first scheme, that of an election by the
legislature, finally prevailed by an unanimous vote.
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">
   20
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 702
 </b>
 The reasoning, by which this mode of appointment was
supported, does
not appear at large in any contemporary debates. But it may be gathered
from the imperfect lights left us, that the main grounds were, that it
would immediately connect the state governments with the national
government, and thus harmonize the whole into one universal system; that it
would introduce a powerful check upon rash legislation, in a manner not
unlike that created by the different organizations of the house of commons,
and the house of lords in Great Britain; and that it would increase public
confidence by securing the national government from undue encroachments on
the powers of the states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#21">
   21
  </a>
 </sup>
 The Federalist notices the subject in the
following brief and summary manner, which at once establishes the general
consent to the arrangement, and the few objections, to which it was
supposed to be obnoxious. "It is unnecessary to dilate on the appointment
of senators by the state legislatures. Among the various modes, which might
have been devised for constituting this branch of the government, that
which has been proposed by the convention is probably the most congenial
with the public opinion. It is recommended by the double advantage of
favouring a select appointment, and of giving to the state governments such
an agency in the formation of the federal government, as must secure the
authority of the former, and may form a convenient link between the two
systems."
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
 This is very subdued praise; and indicates more doubts, than
experience has, as yet, justified.
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 703.
 </b>
 The constitution has not provided for the manner, in which the
choice shall be made by the state legislatures, whether by a joint, or by a
concurrent vote; the latter is, where both branches form one assembly, and
give a united vote numerically; the former is, where each branch gives a
separate and independent vote.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">
   24
  </a>
 </sup>
 As each of the state legislatures now
consists of two branches, this is a very important practical question.
Generally, but not universally, the choice of senators is made by a
concurrent vote.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 Another question might be suggested, whether the
executive constitutes a part of the legislature for such a purpose, in
cases where the state constitution gives him a qualified negative upon the
laws. But this has been silently and universally settled against the
executive participation in the appointment.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 704.
 </b>
 Thirdly; the number of senators. Each state is entitled
to two
senators. It is obvious, that to ensure competent knowledge and ability to
discharge all the functions entrusted to the senate, (of which more will be
said hereafter,) it is indispensable, that it should consist of a number
sufficiently large to ensure a sufficient variety of talents, experience,
and practical skill, for the discharge of all their duties. The legislative
power alone, for its enlightened and prudent exercise, requires (as has
been already shown) no small share of patriotism, and knowledge, and
ability. In proportion to the extent and variety of the labours of
</p>
<p>
 legislation, there should be members, who should share them, in order, that
there may be a punctual and perfect performance of them. If the number be
very small, there is danger, that some of the proper duties will be
overlooked, or neglected, or imperfectly attended to. No human genius, or
industry, is adequate to all the vast concerns of government, if it be not
aided by the power and skill of numbers. The senate ought, therefore, on
this account alone, to be somewhat numerous, though it need not, and indeed
ought not, for other reasons, to be as numerous, as the house. Besides;
numbers are important to give to the body a sufficient firmness to resist
the influence, which the popular branch will ever be solicitous to exert
over them. A very small body is more easy to be overawed, and intimidated,
and controlled by external influences, than one of a reasonable size,
embracing weight of character, and dignity of talents. Numbers alone, in
many cases, confer power; and what is of not less importance, they present
more resistance to corruption and intrigue. A body of five may be bribed,
or overborne, when a body of fifty would be an irresistible barrier to
usurpation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 705.
 </b>
 In addition to this consideration, it is desirable,
that a state
should not be wholly unrepresented in the national councils by mere
accident, or by the temporary absence of its representative. If there be
but a single representative, sickness or casualty may deprive the state of
its vote on the most important occasions. It was on this account, (as well
as others,) that the confederation entitled each state to send not less
than two, nor more than seven delegates. In critical cases, too, it might
be of great importance to have an opportunity of consulting with a
colleague or col-
</p>
<p>
 leagues, having a common interest and reeling for the state. And if it be
not always in the strictest sense true, that in the multitude of counsel
there is safety; there is a sufficient foundation in the infirmity of human
nature to make it desirable to gain the advantage of the wisdom, and
information, and reflection of other independent minds, not labouring under
the suspicion of any unfavourable bias. These reasons may be presumed to
have had their appropriate weight in the deliberations of the convention.
If more than one representative of a state was to be admitted into the
senate, the least practicable ascending number was that adopted. At that
time a single representative of each state would have made the body too
small for all the purposes of its institution, and all the objects before
explained. It would have been composed but of thirteen; and supposing no
absences, which could not ordinarily be calculated upon, seven would
constitute a majority to decide all the measures. Twenty-six was not, at
that period, too large a number for dignity, independence, wisdom,
experience, and efficiency. And, at the present moment, when the states
have grown to twenty-four, it is found, that forty-eight is a number quite
small enough to perform the great national functions confided to it, and to
embody the requisite skill and ability to meet the increased exigencies,
and multiplied duties of the office.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">
   26
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is probably no legislative
body on earth, whose duties are more various, and interesting, and
important to the public wel-
</p>
<p>
 fare; and none, which calls for higher talents, and more comprehensive
attainments, and more untiring industry, and integrity.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 706.
 </b>
 In the convention there was a considerable diversity of
opinion, as
to the number, of which the senate should consist, and the apportionment of
the number among the states. When the principle of an equality of
representation was decided, the only question seems to have been, whether
each state should have three, or two members. Three was rejected by a vote
of nine states against one; and two inserted by a vote of nine states
against one.
 <sup>
  <a href="#27">
   27
  </a>
 </sup>
 It does not appear, that any proposition was ever
entertained for a less number than two; and the silence of all public
discussion on this subject seems to indicate, that the public opinion
decidedly adopted the lowest number under the confederation to be the
proper number, if an equality of representation was to be admitted into the
senate. Whatever may be the future increase of states in the Union, it is
scarcely probable, that the number will ever exceed that, which will fit
the senate for the best performance of all its exalted functions. The
British house of lords, at this moment, probably exceeds any number, which
will ever belong to the American senate; and yet, notwithstanding the
exaggerated declamation of a few ardent minds, the sober sense of the
nation has never felt, that its number was either a burthen, or an
infirmity inherent in the constitution.
 <sup>
  <a href="#28">
   28
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 707.
 </b>
 Fourthly; the term of service of the senators. It is
for six years;
although, as will be present-
</p>
<p>
 ly seen, another element in the composition of that body is, that one third
of it is changed every two years.
</p>
<p>
 What would be the most proper period of office for senators, was an
inquiry, admitting of a still wider range of argument and opinions than
what would be the most proper for the members of the house of
representatives. The subject was confessedly one full of intricacy, and
doubt, upon which the wisest statesmen might well entertain very different
views, and the best patriots might well ask for more information, without,
in the slightest degree, bringing into question their integrity, their love
of liberty, or their devotion to a republican government. If, in the
present day, the progress of public opinion, and the lights of experience,
furnish us with materials for a decided judgment, we ought to remember,
that the question was then free to debate, and the fit conclusion was not
easily to be seen, or justly to be measured. The problem to be solved by
the great men of that day was, what organization of the legislative power,
in a republican government, is best adapted to give permanency to the
Union, and security to public liberty. In the convention, a great diversity
of judgment was apparent among those, whose purity and patriotism were
above all suspicion, and whose talents and public services were equally
unquestionable. Various propositions were entertained; that the period of
service of senators should be during good behaviour; for nine years; for
seven years; for six years; for five years; for four years; for three
years.
 <sup>
  <a href="#29">
   29
  </a>
 </sup>
 All these propositions successively failed, except that for seven
years, which was eventually abandoned for six years with the addi-
</p>
<p>
 tional limitation, that one third should go out biennially.
 <sup>
  <a href="#30">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 708.
 </b>
 No inconsiderable array of objections was brought to
bear against
this prolonged term of service of the senators beyond that fixed for the
members of the house of representatives, both in the convention, and before
the people, when the constitution was under their advisement.
 <sup>
  <a href="#31">
   31
  </a>
 </sup>
 Perhaps
some of those objections still linger in the minds of many, who entertain a
general jealousy of the powers of the Union; and who easily persuade
themselves on that account, that power should frequently change hands in
order to prevent corruption and tyranny. The perpetuity of a body (it has
been said) is favourable to every stride it may be
</p>
<p>
 disposed to make towards extending its own power and influence in the
government. Such a tendency is to be discovered in all bodies, however
constituted, and to which no effectual check can be opposed, but frequent
dissolutions and elections.
 <sup>
  <a href="#32">
   32
  </a>
 </sup>
 The truth of this remark may be admitted;
but there are many circumstances, which may justly vary its force and
application. While, on the one hand, perpetuity in a body may be
objectionable, on the other hand, continual fluctuations may be no less so,
with reference to its duties and functions, its powers, and its efficiency.
There are dangers arising from too great frequency in elections, as well as
from too small. The path of true wisdom is probably best attained by a
moderation, which avoids either extreme. It may be said of too much
jealousy, and of too much confidence, that, when either is too freely
admitted into public councils, it betrays like treason.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 709.
 </b>
 It seems paradoxical to assert, (as has been already
intimated,)
but it is theoretically, as well as practically true, that a deep-felt
responsibility is incompatible with great frequency of elections.
 <sup>
  <a href="#33">
   33
  </a>
 </sup>
 Men
can feel little interest in power, which slips away almost as soon, as it
is grasped; and in measures, which they can scarcely do more than begin,
without hoping to perfect. Few measures have an immediate and sensible
operation, exactly according to their wisdom or policy. For the most part,
they are dependent upon other measures, or upon time, and gradual
intermixtures with the business of life, and the general institutions of
society.
 <sup>
  <a href="#34">

 The first superficial view may shock popular prejudices, or
errors; while the ultimate results may be as admira-
</p>

 ble and excellent, as they are profound and distant. Who can take much
interest in weaving a single thread into a measure, which becomes an
evanescent quantity in the main fabric, whose texture requires constant
skill, and many adaptations from the same hand, before its perfection can
be secured, or even be prophesied?
</p>

 <b>
  § 710.
 </b>
 The objections to the senatorial term of office all resolve
themselves into a single argument, however varied in its forms, or
illustrations. That argument is, that political power is liable to be
abused; and that the great security for public liberty consists in bringing
home responsibility, and dependence in those, who are entrusted with
office; and these are best attained by short periods of office, and
frequent expressions of public opinion in the choice of officers. If the
argument is admitted in its most ample scope, it still leaves the question
open to much discussion, what is the proper period of office, and how
frequent the elections should be. This question must, in its nature, be
complicated; and may admit, if it does not absolutely require, different
answers, as applicable to different functionaries. Without wandering into
ingenious speculations upon the topic in its most general form, our object
will be to present the reasons, which have been, or may be relied on, to
establish the sound policy and wisdom of the duration of office of the
senators as fixed by the constitution. In so doing, it will become necessary
to glance at some suggestions, which have already occurred in considering
the organization of the other branch of the legislature. It may be proper,
however, to premise, that the whole reasoning applies to a moderate
duration only in office; and that it assumes, as its basis, the absolute
necessity of short limitations of office, as constituting indispensable
checks to power in all republican governments. It
</p>
<p>
 would almost be useless to descant upon such a basis, because it is
universally admitted in the United States as a fundamental principle of all
their constitutions of government.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 711.
 </b>
 In the first place, then, all the reasons, which apply
to the
duration of the legislative office generally, founded upon the advantages
of various knowledge, and experience in the principles and duties of
legislation, may be urged with increased force in regard to the senate. A
good government implies two things; first, fidelity to the object of
government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge of
the means, by which that object is to be attained. Some governments are
deficient in both these qualities; most ate deficient in the first. Some of
our wisest statesmen have not scrupled to assert, that in the American
governments too little attention has been paid to the latter.
 <sup>
  <a href="#35">
   35
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is
utterly impossible for any assembly of men, called for the most part from
the pursuits of private life, continued in appointment for a short time,
and led by no permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation
to the study of the nature and operations of government, to escape from the
commission of many errors in the discharge of their legislative functions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#36">
   36
  </a>
 </sup>
 In proportion to the extent and variety of these functions, the national
interests, which they involve, and the national duties, which they imply,
ought to rise the intellectual qualifications, and solid attainments of the
members. Even in our domestic concerns, what are our voluminous, and even
changing codes, but monu-
</p>
<p>
 ments of deficient wisdom, hasty resolves, and still more hasty repeals?
What are they, but admonitions to the people of the dangers of rash, and
premature legislation,
 <sup>
  <a href="#37">
   37
  </a>
 </sup>
 of ignorance, that knows not its own mistakes, or
of overweening confidence, which heeds not its own follies?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 712.
 </b>
 A well constituted senate, then, which should interpose some
restraints upon the sudden impulses of a more numerous branch, would, on
this account, be of great value.
 <sup>
  <a href="#38">
   38
  </a>
 </sup>
 But its value would be incalculably
increased by making its term of office such, that with moderate industry,
talents, and devotion to the public service, its members could scarcely
fail of having the reasonable information, which would guard them against
gross errors, and the reasonable firmness, which would enable them to
resist visionary speculations, and popular excitements. If public men know,
that they may safely wait for the gradual action of a sound public opinion,
to decide upon the merit of their actions and measures, before they can be
struck down, they will be more ready to assume responsibility, and
pretermit present popularity for future solid reputation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#39">
   39
  </a>
 </sup>
 If they are
designed, by the very structure of the government, to secure the states
against encroachments upon their rights and liberties, this very permanence
of office adds new means to effectuate the object. Popular opinion may,
perhaps, in its occasional extravagant sallies, at the instance of a
fawning demagogue, or a favorite chief, incline to overleap the
constitutional barriers, in order
</p>
<p>
 to aid their advancement, or gratify their ambition. But the solid judgment
of a senate may stay the evil, if its own duration of power exceeds that of
the other branches of the government, or if it combines the joint
durability of both. In point of fact, the senate has this desirable limit.
It combines the period of office of the executive with that of the members
of the house; while at the same time, from its own biennial changes, (as we
shall presently see,) it is silently subjected to the deliberate voice of
the states.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 713.
 </b>
 In the next place, mutability in the public councils,
arising from
a rapid succession of new members, is found by experience to work, even in
domestic concerns, serious mischiefs. It is a known fact in the history of
the states, that every new election changes nearly or quite one half of its
representatives;
 <sup>
  <a href="#40">
   40
  </a>
 </sup>
 and in the national government changes less frequent, or
less numerous can scarcely be expected. From this change of men, there must
unavoidably arise a change of opinions; and with this change of opinions a
correspondent change of measures. Now experience demonstrates, that a
continual change, even of good measures, is inconsistent with every rule of
prudence and every prospect of success.
 <sup>
  <a href="#41">
   41
  </a>
 </sup>
 In all human affairs, time is
required to consolidate the elements of the best concerted measures, and to
adjust the little interferences, which are incident to all legislation.
Perpetual changes in public institutions not only occasion intolerable
controversies, and sacrifices of private interests; but check the growth of
that steady industry and enterprise, which, by wise forecast, lay up the
means of future prosperity. Besides; the instability of public councils
gives an unrea-
</p>
<p>
 sonable advantage to the sagacious, the cunning, and the monied
capitalists. Every new regulation concerning commerce, or revenue, or
manufactures, or agriculture, or in any manner affecting the relative value
of the different species of property, presents a new harvest to those, who
watch the change, and can trace the consequences; a harvest, which is torn
from the hand of the honest labourer, or the confiding artisan, to enrich
those, who coolly look on to reap profit, where they have sown nothing.
 <sup>
  <a href="#42">
   42
  </a>
 </sup>
 In short, such a state of things generates the worst passions of
selfishness, and the worst spirit of gaming. However paradoxical it may
seem, it is nevertheless true, that in affairs of government, the best
measures, to be safe, must be slowly introduced; and the wisest councils
are those, which proceed by steps, and reach, circuitously, their
conclusion. It is, then, important in this general view, that all the
public functionaries should not terminate their offices at the same period.
The gradual infusion of new elements, which may mingle with the old,
secures a gradual renovation, and a permanent union of the whole.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 714.
 </b>
 But the ill effects of a mutable government are still
more strongly
felt in the intercourse with foreign nations. It forfeits the respect and
confidence of foreign nations, and all the advantages connected with
national character.
 <sup>
  <a href="#43">
   43
  </a>
 </sup>
 It not only lays its measures open to the silent
operations of foreign intrigue and management; but it subjects its whole
policy to be counteracted by the wiser and more stable policy of its
foreign rivals and adversaries. One nation is to another, what one
individual is to another, with this mel-
</p>
<p>
 ancholy distinction perhaps, that the former, with fewer benevolent
emotions than the latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking undue
advantages of the indiscretions of each other.
 <sup>
  <a href="#44">
   44
  </a>
 </sup>
 If a nation is
perpetually fluctuating in its measures, as to the protection of
agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, it exposes all its infirmities of
purpose to foreign nations; and the latter with a systematical sagacity
will sap all the foundations of its prosperity. From this cause, under the
confederation, America suffered the most serious evils. "She finds," said
the Federalist,
 <sup>
  <a href="#45">
   45
  </a>
 </sup>
 with unusual boldness and freedom, "that she is held in
no respect by her friends; that she is the derision of her enemies; and
that she is a prey to every nation, which has an interest in speculating on
her fluctuating councils, and embarrassed affairs."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 715.
 </b>
 Further; foreign governments can never safely enter into any
permanent arrangements with one, whose councils and government are
perpetually fluctuating. It was not unreasonable, therefore, for them to
object to the continental congress, that they could not guaranty the
fulfilment of any treaty; and therefore it was useless to negotiate any. To
secure the respect of foreign nations, there must be power to fulfil
engagements; confidence to sustain them; and durability to ensure their
execution on the part of the government. National character in cases of
this sort is inestimable. It is not sufficient, that there should be a
sense of justice, and disposition to act right; but there must be an
enlightened permanency in the policy
</p>
<p>
 of the government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#46">
   46
  </a>
 </sup>
 Caprice is just as mischievous, as folly, and
corruption scarcely worse, than perpetual indecision and fluctuation. In
this view, independent of its legislative functions, the participation of
the senate in the functions of the executive, in appointing, ambassadors,
and in forming treaties with foreign nations, gives additional weight to
the reasoning in favour of its prolonged term of service. A mole full
survey of its other functions will make that reasoning absolutely
irresistible, if the object is, that they should be performed with
independence, with judgment, and with scrupulous integrity and dignity.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 716.
 </b>
 In answer to all reasoning of this sort, it has been
strenuously
urged, that a senate, constituted, not immediately by the people, for six
years, may gradually acquire a dangerous pre-eminence in the government,
and eventually transform itself into an aristocracy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#47">
   47
  </a>
 </sup>
 Certainly, such a
case is possible; but it is scarcely within the range of probability, while
the people, or the government, are worthy of protection or confidence.
Liberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty, as well as by the
abuses of power. There are quite as numerous instances of the former, as of
the latter.
 <sup>
  <a href="#48">
   48
  </a>
 </sup>
 Yet, who would reason, that there should be no liberty,
because it had been, or it might be, abused? Tyranny itself would not
desire a more cogent argument, than that the danger of abuse was a ground
for the denial of a right.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 717.
 </b>
 But the irresistible reply to all such reasoning is,
that before
such a revolution can be effected, the
</p>
<p>
 senate must, in the first place, corrupt itself; it must next corrupt the
state legislatures; it must then corrupt the house of representatives; and,
lastly, it must corrupt the people at large. Unless all these things are
done, and continued, the usurpation of the senate would be as vain, as it
would be transient. The periodical change of its members would otherwise
regenerate the whole body. And if such universal corruption should prevail,
it is quite idle to talk of usurpation and aristocracy; for the government
would then be exactly, what the people would choose it to be. It would
represent exactly, what they would deem fit. It would perpetuate power in
the very form, which they would advise. No form of government ever proposed
to contrive a method, by which the will of the people should be at once
represented, and defeated; by which it should choose to be enslaved, and at
the same time, by which it should be protected in its freedom. Private and
public virtue is the foundation of republics; and it is folly, if it is not
madness, to expect, that rulers will not buy, what the people are eager to
sell. The people may guard themselves against the oppressions of their
governors; but who shall guard then against their own oppression of
themselves?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 718.
 </b>
 But experience is, after all, the best test upon all
subjects of
this sort. Time, which dissolves the frail fabrics of men's opinions,
serves but to confirm the judgments of nature. What are the lessons, which
the history of our own and other institutions teach us? In Great-Britain,
the house of lords is hereditary; and yet it has never hitherto been able
successfully to assail the public liberties; and it has not unfrequently
preserved, or enforced them. The house of commons is now chosen for seven
years. Is it now less an organ
</p>
<p>
 of the popular opinion, and less jealous of the public rights, than it was
during annual, or triennial parliaments? In Virginia, the house of
delegates before the revolution, was chosen for seven years; and in some of
the other colonies for three years.
 <sup>
  <a href="#49">
   49
  </a>
 </sup>
 Were they then subservient to the
crown, or faithless to the people? In the present constitutions of the
states of America, there is a great diversity in the terms of office, as
well as the qualifications, of the state senates. In New-York, Virginia,
Pennsylvania, and Kentucky the senate is chosen for four years;
 <sup>
  <a href="#50">
   50
  </a>
 </sup>
 in
Delaware, Mississippi, and Alabama, for three years; in South-Carolina,
Tennessee, Ohio, Missouri, and Louisiana, biennially; in Maryland, for five
years; in the other states annually.
 <sup>
  <a href="#51">
   51
  </a>
 </sup>
 These diversities are as striking in
the constitutions, which were framed as long ago, as the times of the
revolution, as in those, which are the growth, as it were, of yesterday. No
one, with any show of reason or fact, can pretend, that the liberties of
the people have not been quite as safe, and the legislation quite as
enlightened and pure in those states, where the senate is chosen for a
long, as for a short period.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 719.
 </b>
 If there were any thing in the nature of the
objections, which have
been under consideration, or in general theory to warrant any conclusion,
it would be, that the circumstances of the states being nearly equal, and
the objects of legislation the same, the same duration of office ought to
be applied to all. Yet this diversity has existed without any assignable
inconvenience in its practical results. It is manifest,
</p>
<p>
 then, that the different manners, habits, institutions, and other
circumstances of a society, may admit, if they do not require, many
different modifications of its legislative department, without danger to
liberty on the one hand, or gross imbecility on the other. There are many
guards and checks, which are silently in operation, to fortify the
benefits, or to retard the mischiefs of an imperfect system. In the choice
of organizations, it may be affirmed, that that is on the whole best, which
secures in practice the most zeal, experience, skill, and fidelity in the
discharge of the legislative functions. The example of Maryland is perhaps
more striking and instructive, than any one, which has been brought under
review; for it is more at variance with all the objections raised against
the national senate. In Maryland, the senate is not only chosen for five
years; but it possesses the exclusive right to fill all vacancies in its
own body, and has no rotation during the term.
 <sup>
  <a href="#52">
   52
  </a>
 </sup>
 What a fruitful source
might not this be of theoretical objections, and colourable alarms, for the
safety of the public liberties? Yet, Maryland continues to enjoy all the
blessings of good government, and rational freedom, without molestation,
and without dread. If examples are sought from antiquity, the illustrations
are not less striking. In Sparta, the ephori, the annual representatives of
the people, were found an over-match for a senate for life; continually
gaining authority; and finally drawing all power into their own hands. The
tribunes of Rome, who were the representatives of the people, prevailed, in
almost every contest, with the senate for life; and in the end gained a
complete triumph over it, notwithstanding unanimity
</p>
<p>
 among the tribunes was indispensable. This fact proves the irresistible
force possessed by that branch of the government, which represents the
popular will.
 <sup>
  <a href="#53">
   53
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 720.
 </b>
 Considering, then, the various functions of the senate, the
qualifications of skill, experience, and information, which are required to
discharge them, and the importance of interposing, not a nominal, but a
real check, in order to guard the states from usurpations upon their
authority, and the people from becoming the victims of violent paroxysms in
legislation; the term of six years would seem to hit the just medium
between a duration of office, which would too much resist, and a like
duration, which would too much invite those changes of policy, foreign and
domestic, which the best interests of the country may require to be
deliberately weighed, and gradually introduced. If the state governments
are found tranquil, and prosperous, and safe, with a senate of two, three,
four, and five years' duration, it would seem impossible for the Union to
be in danger from a term of service of six years.
 <sup>
  <a href="#54">
   54
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 721.
 </b>
 But, as if to make assurance doubly sure, and take a
bond of fate,
in order to quiet the last lingering scruples of jealousy, the succeeding
clause of the constitution has interposed an intermediate change in the
elements of the body, which would seem to make it absolutely above
exception, if reason, and not fear, is to prevail; and if government is to
be a reality, and not a vision.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 722.
 </b>
 It declares, "Immediately after they (the senators) shall be
assembled, in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided, as
equally as may be, into three classes. The seats of the senators of
</p>
<p>
 the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year; of
the second class, at the expiration of the fourth year; and of the third
class, at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one third may be chosen
every second year." A proposition was made in the convention, that the
senators should be chosen for nine years, one third to go out biennially,
and was lost, three states voting in the affirmative, and eight in the
negative; and then the present limitation was adopted by a vote of seven
states against four.
 <sup>
  <a href="#55">
   55
  </a>
 </sup>
 Here, then, is a clause, which, without impairing
the efficiency of the senate for the discharge. of its high functions,
gradually changes its members, and introduces a biennial appeal. to the
states, which must for ever prohibit any permanent combination for sinister
purposes. No person would probably propose a less duration of office for
the senate, than double the period of the house. In effect, this provision
changes the composition of two thirds of that body within that period.
 <sup>
  <a href="#56">
   56
  </a>
 </sup>
 §
723. And here, again, it is proper to remark, that experience has
established the fact beyond all controversy, that the term of the senate is
not too long, either for its own security, or that of the states. The
reasoning of those exalted minds, which framed the constitution, has been
fully realized in practice. While the house of representatives has gone on
increasing, and deepening its influence with the people with an
irresistible power, the senate has, at all times, felt the im-
</p>
<p>
 pulses of the popular will, and has never been found to resist any solid
improvements. Let it be added, that it has given a dignity, a solidity, and
an enlightened spirit to the operations of the government, which have
maintained respect abroad, and confidence at home.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 724.
 </b>
 At the first session of congress under the constitution, the
division of the senators into three classes was made in the following
manner. The senators present were divided into three classes by name, the
first consisting of six persons, the second of seven, and the third of six.
Three papers of an equal size. numbered one, two, and three, were, by the
secretary, rolled up, and put into a box, and drawn by a committee of three
persons, chosen for the purpose in behalf of the respective classes, in
which each of them was placed; and the classes were to vacate their seats
in the senate, according to the order of the numbers drawn for them,
beginning with number one. It was also provided, that when senators should
take their seats from states, which had not then appointed senators, they
should be placed by lot in the foregoing classes, but in such a manner, as
should keep the classes as nearly equal, as possible.
 <sup>
  <a href="#57">
   57
  </a>
 </sup>
 In arranging the
original classes, care was taken, that both senators from the same state
should not be in the same class, so that there never should be a vacancy,
at the same time, of the seats of both senators.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 725.
 </b>
 As vacancies might occur in the senate during the
recess of the
state legislature, it became indispensable to provide for that exigency.
Accordingly the same clause proceeds to declare: "And if vacancies
happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess
</p>
<p>
 of the legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary
appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then
fill such vacancies." It does not appear, that any strong objection was
urged, in the convention, against this proposition, although it was not
adopted without some opposition.
 <sup>
  <a href="#58">
   58
  </a>
 </sup>
 There seem to have been three courses
presented for the consideration of the convention; either to leave the
vacancies unfilled until the meeting of the state legislature; or to allow
the state legislatures to provide at their pleasure, prospectively for the
occurrence; or to confide a temporary appointment to some select state
functionary or body. The latter was deemed the most satisfactory and
convenient course. Confidence might justly be reposed in the state
executive, as representing at once the interests and wishes of the state,
and enjoying all the proper measures of knowledge and responsibility, to
ensure a judicious appointment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#59">
   59
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 726.
 </b>
 Fifthly; the qualifications of senators. The
constitution declares,
that "No person shall be a sen-
</p>
<p>
 ator, who shall not have attained the age of thirty years, and been nine
years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be
an inhabitant of that state, for which he shall be chosen." As the nature
of the duties of a senator require more experience, knowledge, and
stability of character, than those of a representative, the qualification
in point of age is raised. A person may be a representative at twenty-five;
but he cannot be a senator until thirty. A similar qualification of age was
required of the members of the Roman senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#60">
   60
  </a>
 </sup>
 It would have been a
somewhat singular anomaly in the history of free governments, to have found
persons actually exercising the highest functions of government, who, in
some enlightened and polished countries, would not be deemed to have
arrived at an age sufficiently mature to be entitled to all the private and
municipal privileges of manhood. In Rome persons were not deemed at full
age until twenty-five; and that continues to be the rule in France, and
Holland, and other civil law countries; and in France, by the old law, in
regard to marriage full age was not attained until thirty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#61">
   61
  </a>
 </sup>
 It has since
been varied, and the term diminished.
 <sup>
  <a href="#62">
   62
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 727.
 </b>
 The age of senators was fixed in the constitution at
first by a
vote of seven states against four; and finally, by an unanimous vote.
 <sup>
  <a href="#63">
   63
  </a>
 </sup>
 Perhaps no one, in our day, is disposed to question the propriety of this
limitation; and it is, therefore, useless to discuss a point, which is so
purely speculative. If counsels are to be wise, the ardour, and
impetuosity, and confi-
</p>
<p>
 dence of youth must be chastised by the sober lessons of experience; and if
knowledge, and solid judgment, and tried integrity, are to be deemed
indispensable qualifications for senatorial service, it would be rashness
to affirm, that thirty years is too long a period for a due maturity and
probation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#64">
   64
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 728.
 </b>
 The next qualification is citizenship. The propriety of some
limitation upon admissions to office, after naturalization, cannot well be
doubted. The senate is to participate largely in transactions with foreign
governments; and it seems indispensable, that time should have elapsed
sufficient to wean a senator from all prejudices, resentments, and
partialities, in relation to the land of his nativity, before he should be
entrusted with such high and delicate functions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#65">
   65
  </a>
 </sup>
 Besides; it can
scarcely be presumed, that any foreigner can have acquired a thorough
knowledge of the institutions and interests of a country, until he has been
permanently incorporated into its society, and has acquired by the habits
and intercourse of life the feelings and the duties of a citizen. And if he
has acquired the requisite knowledge, he can scarcely feel that devoted
attachment to them, which constitutes the great security for fidelity and
promptitude in the discharge of official duties. If eminent exceptions
could be stated, they would furnish no safe rule; and should rather teach
us to fear our being misled by brilliancy of talent, or disinterested
patriotism, into a confidence, which might betray, or an acquiescence,
which might weaken, that jealousy of foreign influence, which is one of the
main supports of republics. In the convention
</p>
<p>
 it was at first proposed, that the limitation should be four years; and it
was finally altered by a vote of six states against four, one being
divided, which was afterwards confirmed by a vote of eight states to
three.
 <sup>
  <a href="#66">
   66
  </a>
 </sup>
 This subject has been already somewhat considered in another
place; and it may be concluded, by adopting the language of the Federalist
on the same clause. "The term of nine years appears to be a prudent
mediocrity between a total exclusion of adopted citizens, whose merit and
talents may claim a share in the public confidence, and an indiscriminate
and hasty admission of them, which might create a channel for foreign
influence in the national councils."
 <sup>
  <a href="#67">
   67
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 729.
 </b>
 The only other qualification is, that the senator
shall, when
elected, be an inhabitant of the state, for which he is chosen. This
scarcely requires any comment; for it is manifestly proper, that a state
should be represented by one, who, besides an intimate knowledge of all its
wants and wishes, and local pursuits, should have a personal and immediate
interest in all measures touching its sovereignty, its rights, or its
influence. The only surprise is, that provision was not made for his
ceasing to represent the state in the senate, as soon as he should cease to
be an inhabitant. There does not seem to have been any debate in the
convention on the propriety of inserting the clause, as it now stands.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 730.
 </b>
 In concluding this topic, it is proper to remark, that no
qualification whatsoever of property is established in regard to senators,
as none had been established in regard to representatives. Merit, there-
</p>
<p>
 fore, and talent have the freest access open to them into every department
of office under the national government. Under such circumstances, if the
choice of the people is but directed by a suitable sobriety of judgment,
the senate cannot fail of being distinguished for wisdom, for learning, for
exalted patriotism, for incorruptible integrity, and for inflexible
</p>
<p>
 independence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#68">
   68
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 731.
 </b>
 The next clause of the third section of the first
article respects
the person, who shall preside in the senate. It declares, that "the Vice
President of the United States shall be president of the senate; but shall
have no vote, unless they be equally divided;" and the succeeding clause,
that "the senate shall choose their other officers, and also a president
pro tempore, in the absence of the vice president, or when he shall
exercise the office of president of the United States."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 732.
 </b>
 The original article, as first reported, authorized the
senate to
choose its own president, and other officers; and this was adopted in the
convention.
 <sup>
  <a href="#69">
   69

 But the same draft authorized the president of the senate,
in case of the removal, death, resignation,
 <sup>
  <a href="#70">

 </sup>
 or disability of the
president, to discharge his duties. When at a late period of the convention
it was deemed advisable, that there should be a vice president, the
propriety of retaining him, as presiding officer of the senate, seems to
have met with general favour, eight states voting in the affirmative, and
two only in the negative.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 733.
 </b>
 Some objections have been taken to the appointment of
the vice
president to preside in the senate. It was suggested in the state
conventions,
</p>
<p>
 that the officer was not only unnecessary, but dangerous; that it is
contrary to the usual course of parliamentary proceedings to have a
presiding officer, who is not a member; and that the state, from which he
comes, may thus have two votes, instead of one.
 <sup>
  <a href="#72">
   72
  </a>
 </sup>
 It has also been coldly
remarked by a learned commentator, that "the necessity of providing for the
case of a vacancy in the office of president doubtless gave rise to the
creation of that officer; and for want of something, else for him to do,
whilst there is a president in office, he seems to have been placed, with
no very great propriety, in the chair of the senate."
 <sup>
  <a href="#73">
   73
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 734.
 </b>
 The propriety of creating the office of vice president
will be
reserved for future consideration, when, in the progress of these
commentaries, the constitution of the executive department comes under
review.
 <sup>
  <a href="#74">
   74
  </a>
 </sup>
 The reasons, why he was authorized to preside in the senate,
belong appropriately to this place.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 735.
 </b>
 There is no novelty in the appointment of a person to
preside, as
speaker, who is not a constituent member of the body, over which he is to
preside. In the house of lords in England the presiding officer is the lord
chancellor, or lord keeper of the great seal,
</p>
<p>
 or other person appointed by the king's commission; and if none such be so
appointed, then it is said, that the lords may elect. But it is by no means
necessary, that the person appointed by the king should be a peer of the
realm or lord of parliament.
 <sup>
  <a href="#75">
   75
  </a>
 </sup>
 Nor has this appointment by the king ever
been complained of, as a grievance, nor has it operated with inconvenience
or oppression in practice. It is on the contrary deemed an important
advantage, both to the officer, and to the house of peers, adding dignity
and weight to the former, and securing great legal ability and talent in
aid of the latter. This consideration done might have had some influence in
the convention. The vice president being himself chosen by the states,
might well be deemed, in point of age, character, and dignity, worthy to
preside over the deliberations of the senate, in which the states were all
assembled and represented. His impartiality in the discharge of its duties
might be fairly presumed; and the employment would not only bring his
character in review before the public; but enable him to justify the public
confidence, by performing his public functions with independence, and
firmness, and sound discretion. A citizen, who was deemedworthy of being
one of the competitors for the presidency, could scarcely fail of being
distinguished by private virtues, by comprehensive acquirements, and by
eminent services. In all questions before the senate he might safely be
appealed to, as a fit arbiter upon an equal division, in which case alone
he is entrusted with a vote.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 736.
 </b>
 But the strong motive for this appointment was of
another sort,
founded upon state jealousy, and state equality in the senate. If the
speaker of the
</p>
<p>
 senate was to be chosen from its own members, the state, upon whom the
choice would fall, might possess either more or less, than its due share of
influence. If the speaker were not allowed to vote, except where there was
an equal division, independent of his own vote, then the state might lose
its own voice;
 <sup>
  <a href="#76">
   76
  </a>
 </sup>
 if he were allowed to give his vote, and also a casting
vote, then the state might, in effect, possess a double vote. Either
alternative would of itself present a predicament sufficiently
embarrassing. On the other band, if no casting vote were allowed in any
case, then the indecision and inconvenience might be very prejudicial to
the public interests, in case of an equality of votes.
 <sup>
  <a href="#77">
   77
  </a>
 </sup>
 It might give
rise to dangerous feuds, or intrigues, and create sectional and state
agitations. The smaller states might well suppose, that their interests
were less secure, and less guarded, than they ought to be. Under such
circumstances, the vice president would seem to be the most fit arbiter to
decide, because he would be the representative, not of one state only, but
of all; and must be presumed to feel a lively interest in promoting all
measures for the public good. This reasoning appears to hare been decisive
in the convention, and satisfactory to the people.
 <sup>
  <a href="#78">
   78
  </a>
 </sup>
 It establishes, that
there was a manifest propriety in making the arrangement conducive to the
harmony of the states, and the dignity of the general government. And as
the senate possesses the power to make rules for its own proceedings, there
is little danger, that there can ever arise any abuse of the presiding
power. The danger, if any, is rather the other way, that the presiding
power will be either silently weakened, or openly surrendered, so as to
leave
</p>
<p>
 the office little more, than the barren honour of a place, without
influence and without action.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 737.
 </b>
 A question, involving the authority of the vice
president, as
presiding officer in the senate, has been much discussed in consequence of
a decision recently made by that officer. Hitherto the power of preserving
order during the deliberations of the senate in all cases, where the rules
of the senate did not specially prescribe another mode, had been silently
supposed to belong to the vice president, as an incident of office. It had
never been doubted, much less denied, from the first organization of the
senate, and its existence had been assumed, as an inherent quality,
constitutionally delegated, subject only to such rules, as the senate
should from time to time prescribe. In the winter session of 1826, the vice
president decided in effect, that, as president of the senate, he had no
power of preserving order, or of calling any member to order, for words
spoken in the course of debate, upon his own authority, but only so far, as
it was given, and regulated by the rules of the senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#79">
   79
  </a>
 </sup>
 This was a
virtual surrender of the presiding power (if not universally, at least in
that case) into the hands of the senate; and disarmed the officer even of
the power of selfprotection from insult or abuse, unless the senate should
choose to make provision for it. If, therefore, the senate should decline
to confer the power of preserving order, the vice president might become a
mere pageant and cipher in that body. If, indeed, the vice president had
not this power virtute officii, there was nothing to prevent the senate
from confiding it to any other officer chosen by itself. Nay, if the power
to preside had not this incident, it was difficult to perceive, what other
</p>
<p>
 incident it had. The power to put questions, or to declare votes, might
just as well, upon similar reasoning, be denied, unless it was expressly
conferred. The power of the senate to prescribe rules could not be deemed
omnipotent. It must be construed with reference to, and in connexion with
the power to preside; and the latter, according to the common sense of
mankind, and of public bodies, was always understood to include the power
to keep order; upon the clear ground, that the grant of a power includes
the authority to make it effectual, and also of self-preservation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 738.
 </b>
 The subject at that time attracted a good deal of
discussion; and
was finally, as a practical inquiry, put an end to in 1828, by a rule made
by the senate, that "every question of order shall be decided by the
president without debate, subject to appeal to the senate."
 <sup>
  <a href="#80">
   80
  </a>
 </sup>
 But still the
question, as one of constitutional right and duty, liable to be regulated,
but not to be destroyed by the senate, deserves, and should receive, the
most profound investigation of every man solicitous for the permanent
dignity and independence of the vice presidency.
 <sup>
  <a href="#81">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 739.
 </b>
 The propriety of entrusting the senate with the choice
of its other
officers, and also of a president pro tempore in the absence of the vice
president, or when he exercises the office of president, seems never to
have been questioned; and indeed is so obvious, that it is wholly
unnecessary to vindicate it. Confidence between the senate and its
officers, and the power to make a suitable choice, and to secure a suitable
responsibility for the faithful discharge of the duties of office, are so
indispensable for the public good,
</p>
<p>
 that the provision will command universal assent, as soon as it is
mentioned. It has grown into a general practice for the vice president to
vacate the senatorial chair a short time before the termination of each
session, in order to enable the senate to choose a president pro tempore,
who might already be in office, if the vice president in the recess should
be called to the chair of state. The practice is hounded in wisdom and
sound policy, as it immediately provides for an exigency, which may well be
expected to occur at any time; and prevents the choice from being
influenced by temporary excitements or intrigues, arising from the actual
existence of a vacancy. As it is useful in peace to provide for war; so it
is likewise
useful in times of profound tranquillity to provide for political
agitations, which may disturb the public harmony.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 740.
 </b>
 The next clause of the third section of the first
article respects
the subject of impeachment. It is as follows: "The senate shall have the
sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they
shall be on oath or affirmation. When the president of the United States is
tried, the chief justice shall preside. And no person shall be convicted
without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present"
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 741.
 </b>
 Upon the subject of impeachments something has already
been said,
in treating of that branch of the constitution, which delegates to the
house of representatives the sole power of impeachment. Upon the propriety
of delegating the power it is unnecessary to enlarge. But the next inquiry
naturally presented is, by what tribunal shall an impeachment be tried? It
is obviously incorrect in theory, and against
</p>
<p>
 the general principles of justice, that the same tribunal should at once be
the accusers and the judges; that they should first decide upon the verity
of the accusation, and then try the offenders.
 <sup>
  <a href="#82">
   82
  </a>
 </sup>
 The first object in the
administration of justice is, or ought to be, to secure an impartial trial.
This is so fundamental a rule in all republican governments, that it can
require little reasoning to support it; and the only surprise is, that it
could ever have been overlooked.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 742.
 </b>
 The practice of impeachments seems to have been
originally derived
into the common law from the Germans, who, in their great councils,
sometimes tried capital accusations relating to the public. Licet apud
concilium accusare, quoque et discrimen capitis intendere.
 <sup>
  <a href="#83">
   83
  </a>
 </sup>
 When it was
adopted in England, it received material improvements. In Germany, and also
in the Grecian and Roman republics, the people were, at the same time, the
accusers and the judges; thus trampling down, at the outset, the best
safeguards of the rights and lives of the citizens.
 <sup>
  <a href="#84">
   84
  </a>
 </sup>
 But in England, the
house of commons is invested with the sole power of impeachment, and the
house of lords with the sole power of trial. Thus, a tribunal of high
dignity, independence, and intelligence, and not likely to be unduly swayed
by the influence of popular opinion, is established to protect the accused,
and secure to him a favourable hearing.
 <sup>
  <a href="#85">
   85
  </a>
 </sup>
 Montesquieu has deemed such a
tribunal worthy of the highest praise.
 <sup>
  <a href="#86">
   86
  </a>
 </sup>
 Machiavel has ascribed the ruin
of the republic of Florence to the want of a mode of providing by
</p>
<p>
 impeachment against those, who offend against the state. An American
commentator has hazarded the extraordinary remark, that, "If the want of a
proper tribunal for the trial of impeachments can endanger the liberties of
the United States, some future Machiavel may perhaps trace their
destruction to the same source."
 <sup>
  <a href="#87">
   87
  </a>
 </sup>
 The model, from which the national court
of impeachments is borrowed, is, doubtless, that of Great Britain; and a
similar constitutional distribution of the power exists in many of the
state governments.
 <sup>
  <a href="#88">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 743.
 </b>
 The great objects, to be attained in the selection of a
tribunal
for the trial of impeachments, are, impartiality, integrity, intelligence,
and independence. If either of these is wanting, the trial must be
radically imperfect. To ensure impartiality, the body must be in some
degree removed from popular power and passions, from the influence of
sectional prejudice, and from the more dangerous influence of mere party
spirit. To secure integrity, there must be a lofty sense of duty, and a
deep responsibility to future times, as well as to God. To secure
intelligence, there must be age, experience, and high intellectual powers,
as well as attainments. To secure independence, there must be numbers, as
well as talents, and a confidence resulting at once from permanency of
place, and dignity of station, and enlightened patriotism. Does the senate
combine, in a suitable degree, all these qualifications? Does it combine
them more perfectly, than any other tribunal, which could be constituted?
What other tribunal could be entrusted with the authority? These are
questions of the highest importance, and of the most frequent occurrence.
They arose in the convention, and underwent
</p>
<p>
 a full discussion there. They were again deliberately debated in the state
conventions; and they have been at various times since agitated by jurists
and statesmen, and political bodies. Few parts of the constitution have
been assailed with more vigour; and few have been defended with more
ability. A learned commentator, at a considerable distance of time after
the adoption of the constitution, did not scruple to declare, that it was a
most inordinate power, and in some instances utterly incompatible with the
other functions of the senate;
 <sup>
  <a href="#89">
   89
  </a>
 </sup>
 and a similar opinion has often been
propagated with an abundance of zeal.
 <sup>
  <a href="#90">
   90
  </a>
 </sup>
 The journal of the convention
bears testimony also to no inconsiderable diversity of judgment on the
subject in that body.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 744.
 </b>
 The subject is itself full of intrinsic difficulty in a
government
purely elective. The jurisdiction is to be exercised over offences, which
are committed by public men in violation of their public trust and duties.
Those duties are, in many cases, political; and, indeed, in other cases, to
which the power of impeachment will probably be applied, they will respect
functionaries of a high character, where the remedy would otherwise be
wholly inadequate, and the grievance be incapable of redress. Strictly
speaking, then, the power partakes of a political character, as it respects
injuries to the society in its political character; and, on this account,
it requires to be guarded in its exercise against the spirit of faction,
the intolerance of party, and the sudden movements of popular feeling. The
prosecution will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole
community, and to
</p>
<p>
 divide it into parties, more or less friendly, or hostile to the accused;
The press, with its unsparing vigilance, will arrange itself on either
side, to control, and influence public opinion; and there will always be
some danger, that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative
strength of parties, than by the real proofs of innocence or guilt.
 <sup>
  <a href="#91">
   91
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 745.
 </b>
 On the other hand, the delicacy and magnitude of a
trust, which so
deeply concerns the political existence and reputation of every man engaged
in the administration of public affairs, cannot be overlooked.
 <sup>
  <a href="#92">
   92
  </a>
 </sup>
 It ought
not to be a power so operative and instant, that it may intimidate a modest
and conscientious statesman, or other functionary from accepting office;
nor so weak and torpid, as to be capable of lulling offenders into a
general security and indifference. The difficulty of placing it rightly in
a government, resting entirely on the basis of periodical elections, will
be more strikingly perceived, when it is considered, that the ambitious and
the cunning will often make strong accusations against public men the means
of their own elevation to office; and thus give an impulse to the power of
impeachment, by pre-occupying the public opinion. The convention appears to
have been very strongly impressed with the difficulty of constituting a
suitable tribunal; and finally came to the result, that the senate was the
most fit depositary of this exalted trust. In so doing, they had the
example before them of several of the best considered state constitutions;
and the example, in some measure, of Great Britain. The most strenuous
opponent cannot, therefore, allege, that it was a rash and novel
experiment; the most unequivocal friend
</p>
<p>
 must, at the same time, admit, that it is not free from all plausible
objections.
 <sup>
  <a href="#93">
   93
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 746.
 </b>
 It will be well, therefore, to review the ground, and
ascertain,
how far the objections are well founded; and whether any other scheme would
have been more unexceptionable. The principal objections were as follows:
(1.) That the provision confounds the legislative and judiciary authorities
in the same body, in violation of the well known maxim, which requires a
separation of them. (2.) That it accumulates an undue proportion of power
in the senate, which has a tendency to make it too aristocratic. (3.) That
the efficiency of the court will be impaired by the circumstances, that the
senate has an agency in appointment to office. (4.) That its efficiency is
still further impaired by its participation in the functions of the
treaty-making power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#94">
   94
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 747.
 </b>
 The first objection, which relates to the supposed
necessity of an
entire separation of the legislative and judicial powers, has been already
discussed in its most general form in another place. It has been shown,
that the maxim does not apply to partial intermixtures of these powers; and
that such an intermixture is not only unobjectionable, but is, in many
cases, indispensable for the purpose of preserving the due independence of
the different departments of government, and their harmony and healthy
operation in the advancement of the public interests, and the preservation
of the public liberties.
 <sup>
  <a href="#95">
   95
  </a>
 </sup>
 The question is not so much, whether any
intermixture is allowable, as whether the intermixture of the authority to
try impeachments with the other functions of the senate is salutary
</p>
<p>
 and useful. Now, some of these functions constitute a sound reason for the
investment of the power in this branch. The offences, which the power of
impeachment is designed principally to reach, are those of a political, or
of a judicial character. They are not those, which lie within the scope of
the ordinary municipal jurisprudence of a country. They are founded on
different principles; are governed by different maxims; are directed to
different objects; and require different remedies from those, which
ordinarily apply to crimes.
 <sup>
  <a href="#96">
   96
  </a>
 </sup>
 So far as they are of a judicial character,
it is obviously more safe to the public to confide them to the senate, than
to a mere court of law. The senate may be presumed always to contain a
number of distinguished lawyers, and probably some persons, who have held
judicial stations. At the same time they will not have any undue and
immediate sympathy with the accused from that common professional, or
corporation spirit, which is apt to pervade those, who are engaged in
similar pursuits and duties.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 748.
 </b>
 In regard to political offences, the selection of the
senators has
some positive advantages. In the first place, they may be fairly presumed
to have a more enlarged knowledge, than persons in other situations, of
political functions, and their difficulties, and embarrassments; of the
nature of diplomatic rights and duties; of the extent, limits, and variety
of executive powers and operations; and of the sources of involuntary
error, and undesigned excess, as contradistinguished from those of
meditated and violent disregard of duty and right. On the one hand, this
very experience and knowledge will bring them to the trial with a spirit of
candour and intelligence, and an ability to comprehend,
</p>
<p>
 and scrutinize the charges against the accused; and, on the other hand,
their connection with, and dependence on, the states, will make them feel a
just regard for the defence of the rights, and the interests of the states
and the people. And this may properly lead to another remark; that the
power of impeachment is peculiarly well fitted to be left to the final
decision of a tribunal composed of representatives of all the states,
having a common interest to maintain the rights of all; and yet, beyond the
reach of local and sectional prejudices. Surely, it will not readily be
admitted by the zealous defenders of state rights and state jealousies,
that the power is not safe in the hands of all the states, to be used for
their own protection and honour.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 749.
 </b>
 The next objection regards the undue accumulation of
power in the
senate from this source connected with other sources. So far as any other
powers are incompatible with, and obstructive of, the proper exercise of
the power of impeachment, they will fall under consideration under another
head. But it is not easy to perceive, what the precise nature and extent of
the objection is. What is the due measure or criterion of power to be given
to the senate? What is the standard, which is to be assumed? If we are to
regard theory, no power in any department of government is undue, which is
safe and useful in its actual operations, which is not dangerous in its
form, or too wide in its extent. It is incumbent, then, on those, who press
the objection, to establish, by some sound reasoning, that the power is not
safe, but mischievous or dangerous.
 <sup>
  <a href="#97">
   97
  </a>
 </sup>
 Now, the power of impeachment is not
one expected in any government to be in constant or frequent exercise. It
is rather intended for occasional and extraor-
</p>
<p>
 dinary cases, where a superiour power, acting for the whole people, is put
into operation to protect their rights, and to rescue their liberties from
violation. Such a power cannot, if its actual exercise is properly guarded,
in the hands of functionaries, responsible and wise, be justly said to be
unsafe or dangerous; unless we are to say, that no power, which is liable
to abuse, should be, under any circumstances, delegated. The senators
cannot be presumed in ordinary decency, not to be a body of sufficient
wisdom to be capable of executing, the power; and their responsibility
arises from the moderate duration of their office, and their general stake
in the interests of the community, as well as their own sense of duty and
reputation. If, passing from theory, resort is had to the history of other
governments, there is no reason to suppose, that the possession of the
power of trying impeachments has ever been a source of undue aristocratical
authority, or of dangerous influence. The history of Great Britain has not
established, that the house of lords has become a dangerous depositary of
influence of any sort from its being a high court of impeachments. If the
power of impeachment has ever been abused, it has not trampled upon popular
rights. If it has struck down high victims, it has followed, rather than
led, the popular opinion. If it has been an instrument of injustice, it has
been from yielding too much, and not too little. If it has sometimes
suffered an offender to escape, it has far more frequently purified the
fountains of justice, and brought down the favourite of courts, and the
perverter of patronage to public humiliation and disgrace. And to bring the
case home to our own state governments, the power in our state senates has
hitherto been without danger, though certainly not without efficiency.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 750.
 </b>
 The next objection is, that the power is not efficient or
safe in
connexion with the agency of the senate in appointments. The argument is,
that senators, who have concurred in an appointment, will be too indulgent
judges of the conduct of the men, in whose efficient creation they have
participated.
 <sup>
  <a href="#98">
   98
  </a>
 </sup>
 The same objection lies with equal force against all
governments, which entrust the power of appointment to any persons, who
have a right to remove them at pleasure. It might in such cases be urged,
that the favouritism of the appointor would always screen the misbehaviour
of the appointees. Yet no one doubts the fitness of entrusting such a
power; and confidence is reposed, and properly reposed, in the character
and responsibility of those, who make the appointment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#99">
   99
  </a>
 </sup>
 The objection is
greatly diminished in its force by the consideration, that the senate has
but a slight participation in the appointments to office. The president is
to nominate and appoint; and the senate are called upon merely to confirm,
or reject the nomination. They have no right of choice; and therefore must
feel less solicitude, as to the individual, who is appointed.
 <sup>
  <a href="#100">
   100
  </a>
 </sup>
 But, in
fact, the objection is itself not well founded; for it will rarely occur,
that the persons, who have concurred in the appointment, will be members of
the senate at the time of the trial. As onethird is, or may be, changed
every two years, the case is highly improbable; and still more rarely can
the fact of the appointment operate upon the minds of any considerable
number of the senators. What possible operation could it have upon the
judgment of a man of reasonable intelligence and integrity, that he had
assented to the ap-
</p>
<p>
 pointment of any individual, of whom he ordinarily could have little, or no
personal knowledge, and in whose appointment he had concurred upon the
judgment and recommendation of others? Such an influence is too remote to
be of much weight in human affairs; and if it exists at all, it is too
common to form a just exception to the competency of any forum.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 761.
 </b>
 The next objection is to the inconvenience of the union
of the
power with that of making treaties. It has been strongly urged, that
ambassadors are appointed by the president, with the concurrence of the
senate; and if he makes a treaty, which is ratified by two thirds of the
senate, however corrupt or exceptionable his conduct may have been, there
can be little chance of redress by an impeachment. If the treaty be
ratified, and the minister be impeached for concluding it, because it is
derogatory to the honour, the interest, or perhaps to the sovereignty of
the nation, who (it is said) are to be his judges? The senate, by whom it
has been approved and ratified? If the president be impeached for giving,
improper instructions to the minister, and for ratifying the treaty
pursuant to his instructions, who are to be his judges? The senate, to whom
the treaty has been submitted, and by whom it has been approved and
ratified?
 <sup>
  <a href="#101">
   101
  </a>
 </sup>
 This would be to constitute the senators their own judges in
every case of a corrupt or perfidious execution of their trust.
 <sup>
  <a href="#102">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 752.
 </b>
 Such is the objection pressed with unusual earnestness, and
certainly having a more plausible foundation, than either of the preceding.
It pre-supposes, however, a state of facts of a very extraordinary
character, and having, put an extreme case, argues from
</p>
<p>
 it against the propriety of any delegation of the power, which in such a
case might be abused. This is not just reasoning in any case; and least of
all in cases respecting the polity and organization of governments; for in
all such cases there must be power reposed in some person or body; and
wherever it is reposed, it may be abused. Now, the case put is either one,
where the senate has ratified an appointment or treaty, innocently
believing it to be unexceptionable, and beneficial to the country; or where
the senate has corruptly ratified it, and basely betrayed their trust. In
the former case, the senate having acted with fidelity, according to their
best sense of duty, would feel no sympathy for a corrupt executive or
minister, who had acted with fraud or dishonour unknown to them. If the
treaty were good, they might still desire to punish those, who had acted
basely or corruptly in negotiating it. If bad, they would feel indignation
for the imposition practised upon them by an executive, or minister, in
whom they placed confidence, instead of sympathy for his misconduct. They
would feel, that they had been betrayed into an error; and would rather
have a bias against, than in favour of the deceiver.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 753.
 </b>
 If, on the other hand, the senate had corruptly
assented to the
appointment and treaty, it is certain, that there would remain no effectual
remedy by impeachment, so long as the same persons remained members of the
senate. But even here, two years might remove a large number of the guilty
conspirators; and public indignation would probably compel the resignation
of all. But is such a case supposable? If it be, then there are others
quite within the same range of supposition, and equally mischievous, for
which there can be no remedy. Suppose a majority of the senate,
</p>
<p>
 or house of representatives, corruptly pass any law, or violate the
constitution, where is the remedy? Suppose the house of representatives
carry into effect and appropriate money corruptly in aid of such a corrupt
treaty, where is the remedy? Why might it not be as well urged, that the
house of representatives ought not to be entrusted with the power of
impeachment, because they might corruptly concur with the executive in an
injurious or unconstitutional measure? or might corruptly aid the executive
in negotiating a treaty by public resolves, or secret instructions? The
truth is, that all arguments of this sort, which suppose a combination of
the public functionaries to destroy the liberty of the people, and the
powers of the government, are so extravagant, that they go to the overthrow
of all delegated power; or they are so rare, and remote in practice, that
they ought not to enter, as elements, into any structure of a free
government. The constitution supposes, that men may be trusted with power
under reasonable guards. It presumes, that the senate and the executive
will no more conspire to overthrow the government, than the house of
representatives. It supposes the best pledges for fidelity to be in the
character of the individuals, and in the collective wisdom of the people in
the choice of agents. It does not in decency presume, that the two thirds
of the senate, representing the states, will corruptly unite with the
executive, or abuse their power. Neither does it suppose, that a majority
of the house of representatives will corruptly refuse to impeach, or
corruptly pass a law.

 </b>
 But passing by, for the present, this general reasoning
on the
objections stated, let us see, if any
</p>
<p>
 other and better practical scheme for the trial of impeachments can be
devised. One scheme might be to entrust it to the Supreme Court of the
United States; another, to entrust it to that court, and the senate
jointly; a third, to entrust it to a special tribunal appointed
permanently, or temporarily for the purpose. If it shall appear, that to
all of these schemes equally strong objections may be made, (and probably
none more unexceptionable could be suggested,) the argument in favour of
the senate will acquire more persuasive cogency.

 <b>
  § 755.

 First, the entrusting of the trial of impeachments to
the Supreme
Court. This was, in fact, the original project in the convention.
 <sup>
  <a href="#104">

 It was
at first agreed, that the jurisdiction of the national judiciary should
extend to impeachments of national officers.
 <sup>

 </sup>
 Afterwards this clause was
struck out;
 <sup>
  <a href="#106">

 and the power to impeach was given to the house of
representatives;
 <sup>
  <a href="#107">

 </sup>
 and the jurisdiction of the trial of impeachments was
also given to the Supreme Court.
 <sup>
  <a href="#108">

 Ultimately, the same jurisdiction was
assigned to the senate by the vote of nine states against two.
 <sup>
  <a href="#109">
   109
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 756.
 </b>
 The principal reasons, which prevailed in the
convention in favour
of the final decision, and against vesting the jurisdiction in the Supreme
Court, may fairly be presumed to have been those, which are stated in the
Federalist. Its language is as follows: "Where else, than in the senate,
could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently
independent? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in
its own situation, to preserve, unawed and
</p>
<p>
 uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and
the representatives of the people, his accusers? Could the Supreme Court
have been relied upon, as answering this description? It is much to be
doubted, whether the members of that tribunal would, at all times, be
endowed with so eminent a portion of fortitude, as would be called for in
the exercise of so difficult a task. And it is still more to be doubted,
whether they would possess a degree of credit and authority, which might,
on certain occasions, be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a
decision, which should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their
immediate representatives. A deficiency in the first would be fatal to the
accused; in the last, dangerous to the public tranquillity. The hazard in
both these respects could only be avoided by rendering that tribunal more
numerous, than would consist with a reasonable attention to economy. The
necessity of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments is equally
dictated by the nature of the proceeding. This can never be tied down to
such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offence by the
prosecutors, or in the construction of it by the judges, as in common cases
serve to limit the discretion of courts in favour of personal security.
There will be no jury to stand between the judges, who are to pronounce the
sentence of the law, and the party, who is to receive, or suffer it. The
awful discretion, which a court of impeachments must necessarily have, to
doom to honour or to infamy the most confidential, and the most
distinguished characters of the community, forbids the commitment of the
trust to a small number of persons. These considerations seem alone to
authorize a conclusion, that the Supreme Court would have been an improper
substitute for the senate, as a court of impeachments.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 757.
 </b>
 "There remains a further consideration, which will not a little
strengthen this conclusion. It is this. The punishment, which may be the
consequence of conviction upon impeachment, is not to terminate the
chastisement of the offender. After having been sentenced to a perpetual
ostracism from the esteem, and confidence, and honours, and emoluments of
his country, he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the
ordinary course of law. Would it be proper, that the persons, who had
disposed of his fame, and his most valuable rights, as a citizen, in one
trial, should, in another trial, for the same offence, be also the
disposers of his life and fortune? Would there not be the greatest reason
to apprehend, that error in the first sentence would be the parent of error
in the second sentence? That the strong bias of one decision would be apt
to overrule the influence of any new lights, which might be brought to vary
the complexion of another decision? Those, who know any thing of human
nature, will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative; and
will be at no loss to perceive, that by making the same persons judges in
both cases, those, who might happen to be the objects of prosecution,
would, in a great measure, be deprived of the double security intended them
by a double trial. The loss of life and estate would often be virtually
included in a sentence, which in its terms imported nothing more, than
dismission from a present, and disqualification for a future office. It may
be said, that the intervention of a jury in the second instance would
obviate the danger. But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of
judges. They are sometimes induced to find special verdicts, which refer
the main question to the decision of the court. Who would be willing to
stake his life
</p>
<p>
 and his estate upon a verdict of a jury acting under the auspices of
judges, who had predetermined his guilt?"

<p>
 <b>
  § 758.
 </b>
 That there is great force in this reasoning all persons
of common
candour must allow, that it is in every respect satisfactory and
unanswerable, has been denied, and may be fairly questioned. That part of
it, which is addressed to the trial at law by the same judges might have
been in some degree obviated by confiding the jurisdiction at law over the
offence (as in fact it is now confided) to an inferior tribunal, and
excluding any judge, who sat at the impeachment, from sitting in the court
of trial. Still,however, it cannot be denied, that even in such a case the
prior judgment of the Supreme Court, if an appeal to it were not allowable,
would have very great weight upon the minds of inferior Judges. But that
part of the reasoning, which is addressed to the importance of numbers in
giving weight to the decision, and especially that, which is addressed to
the public confidence and respect, which ought to follow upon a decision,
are entitled to very great weight. It is fit, however, to give the answer
to the whole reasoning by the other side in the words of a learned
commentator, who has embodied it with no small share of ability and skill.
The reasoning, "seems," says he, "to have forgotten, that senators may be
discontinued from their seats, merely from the effect of popular
diapprobation, but that the judges of the Supreme Court cannot. It seems
also to have forgotten, that whenever the president of the United States is
impeached, the constitution expressly requires, that the chief justice of
the Supreme Court shall preside at the
</p>
<p>
 trial. Are all the confidence, all the firmness, and all the impartiality
of that court, supposed to be concentred in the chief justice, and to
reside in his breast only? If that court could not be relied on for the
trial of impeachments, much less would it seem worthy of reliance for the
determination of any question between the United States and a particular
state; much less to decide upon the life and heath of a person, whose
crimes might subject him to impeachment, but whose influence might avert a
conviction. Yet the courts of the United States, are by the constitution
regarded, as the proper tribunals, where a party, convicted upon an
impeachment, may receive that condign punishment, which the nature of his
crimes may require; for it must not be forgotten, that a person, convicted
upon an impeachment, will nevertheless be liable to indictment, trial,
judgment, and punishment according to law, &amp;c. The question, then, might be
retorted; can it be supposed, that the senate, a part of whom must have
been either particeps criminis with the person impeached, by advising the
measure, for which he is to be tried, or must have joined the opposition to
that measure, when proposed and debated in the senate, would be a more
independent, or a more unprejudiced tribunal, than a court, composed of
judges, holding their offices during good behaviour; and who could neither
be presumed to have participated in the crime, nor to have prejudged the
criminal?"
 <sup>
  <a href="#111">
   111
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 759.
 </b>
 This reasoning also has much force in it; but in
candour also it
must be admitted to be not wholly unexceptionable. That part, which is
addressed to the circumstance of the chief justice's presiding at the trial
of the president of the United States, was (as
</p>
<p>
 we shall hereafter see) not founded on any supposition, that the chief
justice would be superior in confidence, and firmness, and impartiality, to
the residue of the judges, (though in talents and public respect, and
acquirements, he might fairly be presumed their superior;) but on the
necessity of excluding the vice president from the chair, when he might
have a manifest interest, which would destroy his impartiality. That part,
which is addressed to the supposition of the senators being participes
criminis, is still more exceptionable; for it is not only incorrect to
affirm, that the senators must be, in such a predicament, but in all
probability the senators would, in almost all cases, be without any
participation in the offence. The offences, which would be generally
prosecuted by impeachment, would be those only of a high character, and
belonging to persons in eminent stations, -- such as a head of department,
a foreign minister, a judge, a vice president, or a president. Over the
conduct of such persons the senate could ordinarily have no control; and a
corrupt combination with them, in the discharge of the duties of their
respective offices, could scarcely be presumed. Any of these officers might
be bribed, or commit gross misdemeanours, without a single senator having
the least knowledge, or participation in the offence. And, indeed, very few
of the senators could, at any time, be presumed to be in habits of intimate
personal confidence, or connexion with many of these officers. And so far,
as public responsibility is concerned, or public confidence is required,
the tenure of office of the judges would have no strong tendency to secure
the former, or to assuage public jealousies, so as peculiarly to encourage
the latter. It is, perhaps, one of the circumstances, most
</p>
<p>
 important in the discharge of judicial duties, that they rarely carry with
them any strong popular favour, or popular influence. The influence, if
any, is of a different sort, arising from dignity of life and conduct,
abstinence from political contests, exclusive devotion to the advancement
of the law, and a firm administration of justice; circumstances, which are
felt more by the profession, than they can be expected to be praised by the
public.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 760.
 </b>
 Besides; it ought not to be overlooked, that such an
additional
accumulation of power in the judicial department would not only furnish
pretexts for clamour against it, but might create a general dread of its
influence, which could hardly fail to disturb the salutary effects of its
ordinary functions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#112">
   112
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is nothing, of which a free people are so apt
to be jealous, as of the existence of political functions, and political
checks, in those, who are not appointed by, and made directly responsible
to themselves. The judicial tenure of office during good behaviour, though
in some respects most favourable for an independent discharge of these
functions and checks, is at the same time obnoxious to some strong
objections, as a remedy for impeachable offences.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 761.
 </b>
 There are, however, reasons of great weight, besides
those, which
have been already alluded to, which fully justify the conclusion, that the
Supreme Court is not the most appropriate tribunal to be invested with
authority to try impeachments.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 762.
 </b>
 In the first place, the nature of the functions to be
performed.
The offences, to which the power of impeachment has been, and is ordinarily
applied, as a remedy, are of a political character. Not but that
</p>
<p>
 crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power,
(for, as we shall presently see, treason, bribery, and other high crimes
and misdemeanours are expressly within it;) but that it has a more enlarged
operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed, political offences, growing
out of personal misconduct, or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual
disregard of the public interests, in the discharge of the duties of
political office. These are so various in their character, and so
indefinable in their actual involutions, that it is almost impossible to
provide systematically for them by positive law. They must be examined upon
very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty. They
must be judged of by the habits, and rules, and principles of diplomacy, of
departmental operations and arrangements, of parliamentary practice, of
executive customs and negotiations, of foreign, as well as of domestic
political movements; and in short, by a great variety of circumstances, as
well those, which aggravate, as those, which extenuate, or justify the
offensive acts, which do not properly belong to the judicial character in
the ordinary administration of justice, and are far removed from the reach
of municipal jurisprudence. They are duties, which are easily understood by
statesmen, and are rarely known to judges. A tribunal, composed of the
former, would therefore be far more competent, in point of intelligence and
ability, than the latter, for the discharge of the functions, all other
circumstances being equal. And surely, in such grave affairs, the
competency of the tribunal to discharge the duties in the best manner is an
indispensable qualification.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 763.
 </b>
 In the next place, it is obvious, that the strictness
of the forms
of proceeding in cases of offen-
</p>
<p>
 ces at common law are ill adapted to impeachments. The very habits growing
out of judicial employments; the rigid manner, in which the discretion of
judges is limited, and fenced in on all sides, in order to protect persons
accused of crimes by rules and precedents; and the adherence to technical
principles, which, perhaps, distinguishes this branch of the law, more than
any other, are all ill adapted to the trial of political offences in the
broad course of impeachments. And it has been observed with great
propriety, that a tribunal of a liberal and comprehensive character,
confined, as little as possible, to strict forms, enabled to continue its
session as long, as the nature of the law may require; qualified to view
the charge in all its bearings and dependencies, and to appropriate on
sound principles of public policy the defence of the accused, seems
indispensable to the value of the trial.
 <sup>
  <a href="#113">
   113
  </a>
 </sup>
 The history of impeachments,
both in England and America, justifies the remark. There is little
technical in the mode of proceeding; the charges are sufficiently clear,
and yet in a general form; there are few exceptions, which arise in the
application of the evidence, which grow out of mere technical roles, and
quibbles. And it has repeatedly been seen, that the functions have been
better understood, and more liberally and justly expounded by statesmen,
than by mere lawyers. An illustrious instance of this sort is upon record
in the case of the trial of Warren Hastings, where the question, whether an
impeachment was abated by a dissolution of parliament, was decided in the
negative by the house of lords, as well as the house of commons, against
what seemed to be the weight of professional opinion.
 <sup>
  <a href="#114">
   114
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 764.
 </b>
 In the next place, the very functions, involving political
interests and connexions, are precisely those, which it seems most
important to exclude from the cognizance and participation of the judges of
the Supreme Court. Much of the reverence and respect, belonging to the
judicial character, arise from the belief, that the tribunal is impartial,
as well as enlightened; just, as well as searching. It is of very great
consequence, that judges should not only be, in fact, above all exception
in this respect; but that they should be generally believed to be so. They
should not only be pure; but, if possible, above suspicion. Many of the
offences, which will be charged against public men, will be generated by
the heats and animosities of party; and the very circumstances, that judges
should be called to sit, as umpires, in the controversies of party, would
inevitably involve them in the common odium of partizans, and place them in
public opinion, if not in fact, at least in form, in the array on one side,
or the other. The habits, too, arising from such functions, will lead them
to take a more ardent part in public discussions, and in the vindication of
their own political decisions, than seems desirable for those, who are
daily called upon to decide upon the private rights and claims of men,
distinguished for their political consequence, zeal, or activity, in the
ranks of party. In a free government, like ours, there is a peculiar
propriety in withdrawing, as much as possible, all judicial functionaries
from the contests of mere party strife. With all their efforts to avoid
them, from the free intercourse, and constant charges in a republican
government, both of men and measures, there is, at all times, the most
imminent danger, that all classes of society will be drawn into the vortex
of politics. Whatever shallhave
</p>
<p>
 a tendency to secure, in tribunals of justice, a spirit of moderation and
exclusive devotion to juridical duties is of inestimable value. What can
more surely advance this object, than the exemption of them from all
participation in, and control over, the acts of political men in their
official duties? Where, indeed, those acts fall within the character of
known crimes at common law, or by positive statute, there is little
difficulty in the duty, because the rule is known, and equally applies to
all persons in and out of office; and the facts are to be tried by a jury,
according to the habitual course of investigation in common cases. The
remark of Mr. Woodeson on this subject is equally just and appropriate.
After having enumerated some of the cases, in which impeachments have been
tried for political offences, he adds, that from these "it is apparent, how
little the ordinary tribunals are calculated to take cognizance of such
offences, or to investigate and reform the general polity of the state."
 <sup>
  <a href="#115">
   115
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 765.
 </b>
 In the next place, the judges of the Supreme Court are
appointed by
the executive; and will naturally feel some sympathy and attachment for the
person, to whom they owe this honour, and for those, whom he selects, as
his confidential advisers in the departments. Yet the president himself,
and those confidential advisers, are the very persons, who are eminently
the objects to be reached by the power of impeachment. The very
circumstance, that some, perhaps a majority of the court, owe their
elevation to the same chief magistrate, whose acts, or those of his
confidential advisers, are on trial, would have some tendency to diminish
the public confidence in the impartiality and independence of the tribunal.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 766.
 </b>
 But, in the next place, a far more weighty consideration
is, that
some of the members of the judicial department may be impeached for
malconduct in office; and thus, that spirit, which, for want of a better
term, has been called the corporation spirit of organized tribunals and
societies, will naturally be brought into play. Suppose a judge of the
Supreme Court should himself be impeached; the number of his triers would
not only be diminished; but all the attachments, and partialities, or it
may be the rivalries and jealousies of peers on the same bench, may be, or
(what is practically almost as mischievous) may be suspected to be put in
operation to screen or exaggerate the offence. Would any person soberly
decide, that the judges of the Supreme Court would be the safest and the
best of all tribunals for the trial of a brother judge, taking human
feelings, as they are, and human infirmity, as it is? If not, would there
not be, even in relation to inferior judges, a sense of indulgence, or a
bias of opinion, upon certain judicial acts and practices, which might
incline their minds to undue extenuation, or to undue harshness? And if
there should be, in fact, no danger from such a source, is there not some
danger, under such circumstances, that a jealousy of the operations of
judicial tribunals over judicial offences, would create in the minds of the
community a broad distinction in regard to convictions and punishments;
between them and merely political offences? Would not the power of
impeachment cease to possess its just reverence and authority, if such a
distinction should prevail; and especially, if political victims rarely
escaped, and Judicial officers as rarely suffered? Can it be desirable thus
to create any tendency in the public mind
</p>
<p>
 towards the judicial department, which may impair its general respect and
daily utility?
 <sup>
  <a href="#116">
   116

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 767.
 </b>
 Considerations of this sort cannot be overlooked in
inquiries of
this nature; and if to some minds they may not seem wholly satisfactory,
they, at least, establish, that the Supreme Court is not a tribunal for the
trial of impeachment, wholly above all reasonable exceptions. But if, to
considerations of this sort, it is added, that the common practice of free
governments, and especially of England, and of the states composing the
Union, has been, to confide this power to one department of the legislative
body, upon the accusation of another; and that this has been found to work
well, and to adjust itself to the public feelings and prejudices, to the
dignity of the legislature, and to the tranquillity of the state, the
inference in its favour cannot but be greatly strengthened and confirmed.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 768.
 </b>
 To those, who felt difficulties in confiding to the
Supreme Court
alone the trial of impeachments, the scheme might present itself, of
uniting that court with the senate jointly for this purpose. To this union
many of the objections already stated, and especially those, founded on the
peculiar functions of the judicial department, would apply with the same
force, as they do to vesting the Supreme Court with the exclusive
jurisdiction. In some other respects there would result advantages from the
union; but they would scarcely overbalance the disadvantages.
 <sup>
  <a href="#117">
   117
  </a>
 </sup>
 If the
judges, compared with the whole body of the senate, were few in number,
their weight would scarcely be felt in that body. The habits of
co-operation in common daily duties
</p>
<p>
 would create among the senators an habitual confidence, and sympathy with
each other; and the same habits would produce a correspondent influence
among the judges. There would, therefore, be two distinct bodies, acting
together pro re nata, which were in a great measure strangers to each
other, and with feelings, pursuits, and modes of reasoning wholly distinct
from each other. Great contrariety of opinion might naturally be presumed
under such circumstances to spring up, and, in all probability, would
become quite marked in the action of the two bodies. Suppose, upon an
impeachment, the senators should be on one side, and the judges on the
other; suppose a minority composed of all the judges, and a considerable
number of the senators; or suppose a majority made by the co-operation of
all the judges; in these, and many other cases, there might be no
inconsiderable difficulty in satisfying the public mind, as to the result
of the impeachment. Judicial opinion might go urgently one way, and
political character and opinion, as urgently another way. Such a state of
things would have little tendency to add weight, or dignity to the court,
in the opinion of the community. And perhaps a lurking suspicion might
pervade many minds, that one body, or the other, had possessed an undue
preponderance of influence in the actual decision. Even jealousies and
discontents might grow up in the bosoms of the component bodies themselves,
from their own difference of structure, and habits, and occupations, and
duties. The practice of governments has not hitherto established any great
value, as attached to the intermixture of different bodies for single
occasions, or temporary objects.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 769.
 </b>
 A third scheme might be, to entrust the trial of
impeachments to a
special tribunal, constituted for
</p>
<p>
 that sole purpose. But whatever arguments may be found in favour of such a
plan, there will be found to be correspondent objections and difficulties.
It would tend to increase the complexity of the political machine, and add
a new spring to the operations of the government, the utility of which
would be at least questionable, and might clog, its just movements.
 <sup>
  <a href="#118">
   118
  </a>
 </sup>
 A
court of this nature would be attended with heavy expenses; and might, in
practice, be subject to many casualties and inconveniences. It must consist
either of permanent officers, stationary at the seat of government, and of
course entitled to fixed and regular stipends; or of national officers,
called to the duties for the occasion, though previously designated by
office, or rank; or of officers of the state governments, selected when the
impeachment was actually depending.
 <sup>
  <a href="#119">
   119
  </a>
 </sup>
 Now, either of these alternatives
would be found full of embarrassment and intricacy, when an attempt should
be made to give it a definite form and organization. The court, in order to
be efficient and independent, ought to be numerous. It ought to possess
talents, experience, dignity, and weight of character, in order to obtain,
or to hold, the confidence of the nation. What national officers, not
belonging to either of the great departments of the government,
legislative, executive, or judicial, could be found, embracing all these
requisite qualifications? And if they could be, what compensation is to be
made to them, in order to maintain their characters and importance, and to
secure their services? If the court is to be selected from the state
functionaries, in what manner is this to be accomplished? How can their
acceptance, or performance of the duties, be
</p>
<p>
 either secured, or compelled? Does it not at once submit the whole power of
impeachment to the control of the state governments, and thus surrender
into their hands all the means of making it efficient and satisfactory? In
political contests it cannot be supposed, that either the states, or the
state functionaries, will not become partisans, and deeply interested in
the success, or defeat of measures, in the triumph; or the ruin of rivals,
or opponents. Parties will naturally desire to screen a friend, or
overwhelm an adversary; to secure the predominance of a local policy, or a
state party; and if so, what guarantee is there for any extraordinary
fidelity, independence, or impartiality, in a tribunal so composed, beyond
all others? Descending from such general inquiries to more practical
considerations, it may be asked, how shall such a tribunal be composed"
Shall it be composed of state executives, or state legislators, or state
judges, or of a mixture of all, or a selection from all? If the body is
very large, it will become unwieldy, and feeble from its own weight. If it
be a mixture of all, it will possess too many elements of discord and
diversities of judgment, and local and professional opinion. If it be
homogeneous in its character, as if it consist altogether of one class of
men, as of the executives of all the states, or the judges of the Supreme
Courts of all the states, can it be supposed, (even if an equality in all
other respects could be certainly obtained,) that persons, selected mainly
by the states for local and peculiar objects, could best administer the
highest and most difficult functions of the national government?

  § 770.
 </b>
 The Federalist has spoken with unusual freedom and
directness on
this subject. "The first scheme," (that is, of vesting the power in some
per-
</p>
<p>
 manent national officers,) "will be reprobated by every man, who can
compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying them.
The second," (that is, of vesting it in state officers,) "will be espoused
with caution by those, who will seriously consider the difficulties of
collecting men dispersed over the whole Union; the injury to the innocent
from the procrastinated determination of the charges, which might be
brought against them; the advantage to the guilty from the opportunities,
which delay would afford for intrigue and corruption; and in some cases the
detriment to the state from the prolonged inaction of men, whose firm and
faithful execution of their duty might have exposed them to the persecution
of an intemperate or designing majority in the house of representatives.
Though this latter supposition may seem harsh, and might not be likely
often to be verified; yet it ought not to be forgotten, that the demon of
faction will, at certain seasons, extend his sceptre over all numerous
bodies of men." And the subject is concluded with the following reflection.
"If mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of government, until
every part of it had been adjusted to the most exact standard ofperfection,
society would soon become a general scene of anarchy, and the world a
desert."

  § 771.
 </b>
 A scheme somewhat different from either of the
foregoing has been
recommended by a learned commentator,
 <sup>
  <a href="#121">
   121
  </a>
 </sup>
 drawn from the Virginia
constitution, by which, in that state, all impeachments are to be tried in
the courts of law, "according to the laws of the land;" and by the state
laws the facts, as in other cases, are to be tried by a jury. But the
objections to this course
</p>
<p>
 would be very serious, not only from the considerations already urged, but
from the difficulty of impanneling a suitable jury for such purposes. From
what state or states is such a jury to be drawn? How is it to be selected,
or composed? What are to be the qualifications of the jurors? Would it be
safe to entrust the political interests of a whole people to a common
panel? Would any jury in times of party excitement by found sufficiently
firm to give a true verdict, unaffected by the popularity or odium of the
measure, when the nation was the accuser?
 <sup>
  <a href="#122">
   122
  </a>
 </sup>
 These questions are more easily
put, than they can be satisfactorily answered. And, indeed, the very
circumstance, that the example of Virginia has found little favour in other
states, furnishes decisive proof, that it is not deemed better than others,
to which the national constitution bears the closest analogy.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 772
 </b>
 When the subject was before the state conventions,
although here and
there an objection was started against the plan, three states only formally
proposed any amendment. Virginia and North-Carolina recommended, "that some
tribunal, other than the senate, be provided for trying impeachments of
senators," 1 leaving, the provision in all other respects, as it stood.
New-York alone recommended an amendment, that the senate, the judges of the
Supreme Court, and the first or senior judge of the highest state court of
general or ordinary common law jurisdiction in each state should constitute
a court for the trial of impeachments.
 <sup>
  <a href="#123">
   123

 This recommendation does not
change the posture of a single objection. It received no support elsewhere;
and the subject has since silently slept without any effort to revive it.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 773.
 </b>
 The conclusion, to which, upon a large survey of the whole
subject,
our judgments are naturally led, is, that the power has been wisely
deposited with the senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#124">
   124
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the language of a learned commentator, it
may be said, that of all the departments of the government, "none will be
found more suitable to exercise this peculiar jurisdiction, than the
senate. Although, like their accusers, they are representatives of the
people; yet they are by a degree more removed, and hold their stations for
a longer term. They are, therefore, more independent of the people, and
being chosen with the knowledge, that they may, while in office, be called
upon to exercise this high function, they bring with them the confidence of
their constituents, that they will faithfully execute it, and the implied
compact on their own part, that it shall be honestly discharged. Precluded
from ever becoming accusers themselves, it is their duty not to lend
themselves to the animosities of party, or the prejudices against
individuals, which may sometimes unconsciously induce the house of
representatives to the acts of accusation. Habituated to comprehensive
views of the great political relations of the country, they are naturally
the best qualified to decide on those charges, which may have any connexion
with transactions abroad, or great political interests at home. And
although we cannot say, that, like the English house of lords, they form a
distinct body, wholly uninfluenced by the passions, and remote from the
interests, of the people; yet we can discover in no other division of the
government a greater probability of impartiality and independence."
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 774.
 </b>
 The remaining parts of the clause of the constitution
now under
consideration will not require an
</p>
<p>
 elaborate commentary. The first is, that the senate, when sitting as a
court of impeachment, "shall be on oath or affirmation;" a provision,
which, as it appeals to the conscience and integrity of the members by the
same sanctions, which apply to judges and jurors, who sit in other trials,
will commend itself to all persons, who deem the highest trusts, rights,
and duties, worthy of the same protection and security, at least, as those
of the humblest order. It would, indeed, be a monstrous anomaly, that the
highest officers might be convicted of the worst crimes, without any
sanction being interposed against the exercise of the most vindictive
passions; while the humblest individual has a right to demand an oath of
fidelity from those, who are his peers, and his triors. In England,
however, upon the trial of impeachments, the house of lords are not under
oath; but only make a declaration upon their honour.
 <sup>
  <a href="#126">
   126
  </a>
 </sup>
 This is a strange
anomaly, as in all civil and criminal trials by a jury, the jurors are
under oath; and there seems no reason, why a sanction equally obligatory
upon the consciences of the triors should not exist in trials for capital
or other offences before every other tribunal. What is there in the honour
of a peer, which necessarily raises it above the honour of a commoner? The
anomaly is rendered still more glaring by the fact, that a peer cannot give
testimony, as a witness, except on oath; for, here, his honour is not
trusted. The maxim of the law, in such a case, is in judicio non creditur,
nisi juratis.
 <sup>
  <a href="#127">
   127
  </a>
 </sup>
 Why should the obligation of a judge be less solemn, than
the obligation of a witness? The truth is, that it is a privilege of power,
conceded in barbarous limes, and founded on feudal sovereignty, more than
on justice, or principle.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 775.
 </b>
 The next provision is: "When the president of the United
States is
tried, the chief justice shall
preside." The reason of this clause has been already adverted to. It was to
preclude the vice president, who might be supposed to have a natural desire
to succeed to the office, from being instrumental in procuring the
conviction of the chief magistrate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#128">
   128
  </a>
 </sup>
 Under such circumstances, who could
be deemed more suitable to preside, than the highest judicial magistrate of
the Union. His impartiality and independence could be as little suspected,
as those of any person in the country. And the dignity of his station might
well be deemed an adequate pledge for the possession of the highest
accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 776.
 </b>
 It is added, "And no person shall be convicted, without the
concurrence of two thirds of the members present." Although very numerous
objections were taken to the constitution, none seems to have presented
itself against this particular quorum required for a conviction; and yet it
might have been fairly thought to be open to attack on various sides from
its supposed theoretical inconvenience and incongruity. It might have been
said with some plausibility, that it deserted the general principles even
of courts of justice, where a mere majority make the decision; and, of all
legislative bodies, where a similar rule is adopted; and, that the
requisition of two thirds would reduce the power of impeachment to a mere
nullity. Besides; upon the trial of impeachments in the house of lords the
conviction or acquittal is by a mere majority;
 <sup>
  <a href="#129">
   129
  </a>
 </sup>
 so that there is a
failure of any analogy to support the precedent.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 777.
 </b>
 It does not appear from any authentic memorials, what were the
precise grounds, upon which this limitation was interposed. But it may well
be conjectured, that the real grounds were, to secure an impartial trial,
and to guard public men from being sacrificed to the immediate impulses of
popular resentment or party predominance. In England, the house of lords,
from its very structure and hereditary independence, furnishes a sufficient
barrier against such oppression and injustice. Mr. Justice Blackstone has
remarked, with manifest satisfaction, that the nobility "have neither the
same interests, nor the same passions, as popular assemblies; and, that "it
is proper, that the nobility should judge, to insure justice to the
accused; as it is proper, that the people should accuse, to insure justice
to the commonwealth."
 <sup>
  <a href="#130">
   130
  </a>
 </sup>
 Our senate is, from the very theory of the
constitution, founded upon a more popular basis; and it was desirable to
prevent any combination of a mere majority of the states to displace, or to
destroy a meritorious public officer. If a mere majority were sufficient to
convict, there would be danger, in times of high popular commotion or party
spirit, that the influence of the house of representatives would be found
irresistible. The only practicable check seemed to be, the introduction of
the clause of two thirds, which would thus require an union of opinion and
interest, rare, except in cases where guilt was manifest, and innocence
scarcely presumable. Nor could the limitation be justly complained of; for,
in common cases, the law not only presumes every man innocent, until he is
proved guilty; but unanimity in the verdict of the jury is indispensable.
Here, an intermediate scale is adopted between unanimity, and a mere
majority. And if the
</p>
<p>
 guilt of a public officer cannot be established to the satisfaction of two
thirds of a body of high talents and acquirements, which sympathizes with
the people, and represents the states, after a full investigation of the
facts, it must be, that the evidence is too infirm, and too loose to
justify a conviction. Under such circumstances, it would be far more
consonant to the notions of justice in a republic, that a guilty person
should escape, than that an innocent person should become the victim of
injustice from popular odium, or party combinations.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 778.
 </b>
 At the distance of forty years, we may look back upon this
reasoning with entire satisfaction. The senate has been found a safe and
effective depositary of the trial of impeachments. During that period but
four cases have occurred, requiring, this high remedy. In three there have
been acquittals; and in one a conviction. Whatever may have been the
opinions of zealous partisans at the times of their occurrence, the sober
judgment of the nation sanctioned these results, at least, on the side of
the acquittals, as soon as they became matters of history, removed from the
immediate influences of the prosecutions. The unanimity of the awards of
public opinion, in its final action on these controversies, has been as
great, and as satisfactory, as can be attributed to any, which involve real
doubt, or enlist warm prejudices and predilections on either side.
 <sup>
  <a href="#131">
   131
  </a>
 </sup>
 No
reproach has ever reached he senate for its unfaithful discharge of these
high functions; and the voice of a
</p>
<p>
 state has rarely, if ever, displaced a single senator for his vote on such
an occasion. What more could be asked in the progress of any government?
What more could experience produce to justify confidence in the
institution?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 779.
 </b>
 The next clause is, that "Judgment in cases of
impeachment shall
not extend further, than to removal from office, and disqualification to
hold and enjoy any office of honour, trust, or profit, under the United
States. But the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to
indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment, according to law."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 780.
 </b>
 It is obvious, that, upon trials on impeachments, one of two
courses must be adopted in case of a conviction; either for the court to
proceed to pronounce a full and complete sentence of punishment for the
offence according to the law of the land in like cases, pending in the
common tribunals of justice, superadding the removal from office, and the
consequent disabilities; or, to confine its sentence to the removal from
office and other disabilities. If the former duty be a part of the
constitutional functions of the court, then, in case of an acquittal, there
cannot be another trial of the party for the same offence in the common
tribunals of justice, because it is repugnant to the whole theory of the
common law, that a man should be brought into jeopardy of life or limb more
than once for the same offence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#132">
   132
  </a>
 </sup>
 A plea of acquittal is, therefore, an
absolute bar against any second prosecution for the same offence. If the
court of impeachments is merely to pronounce a sentence of removal from
office and the other disabilities; then it is indispensable, that provision
should be made, that the common tribunals of jus-
</p>
<p>
 tice should be at liberty to entertain jurisdiction of the offence, for the
purpose of inflicting the common punishment applicable to unofficial
offenders. Otherwise, it might be matter of extreme doubt, whether,
consistently with the great maxim above mentioned, established for the
security of the life and limbs and liberty of the citizen, a second trial
for the same offence could be had, either after an acquittal, or a
conviction in the court of impeachments. And if no such second trial could
be had, then the grossest official offenders might escape without any
substantial punishment, even for crimes, which would subject their fellow
citizens to capital punishment.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 781.
 </b>
 The constitution, then, having provided, that judgment upon
impeachments shall not extend further, than to removal from office, and
disqualification to hold office, (which, however afflictive to an ambitious
and elevated mind, would be scarcely felt, as a punishment, by the
profligate and the base,) has wisely subjected the party to trial in the
common criminal tribunals, for the purpose of receiving such punishment, as
ordinarily belongs to the offence. Thus, for instance, treason, which by
our laws is a capital offence, may receive its appropriate punishment; and
bribery in high officers, which otherwise would be a mere disqualification
from office, may have the measure of its infamy dealt out to it with the
same unsparing severity, which attends upon other and humbler offenders.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 782.
 </b>
 In England, the judgment upon impeachments is not
confined to mere
removal from office; but extends to the whole punishment attached by law to
the offence. The house of lords, therefore, upon a conviction, may, by its
sentence, inflict capital punishment; or perpetual banishment; or
forfeiture of goods
</p>
<p>
 and lands; or fine and ransom; or imprisonment; as well as removal from
office, and incapacity to hold office, according to the nature and
aggravation of the offence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#133">
   133
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 783.
 </b>
 As the offences, to which the remedy of impeachment has
been, and
will continue to be principally applied, are of a political nature,
 <sup>
  <a href="#134">
   134
  </a>
 </sup>
 it is
natural to suppose, that they will be often exaggerated by party spirit,
and the prosecutions be sometimes dictated by party resentments, as well as
by a sense of the public good. There is danger, therefore, that in cases of
conviction the punishment may be wholly out of proportion to the offence,
and pressed as much by popular odium, as by aggravated crime. From the
nature of such offences, it is impossible to fix any exact grade, or
measure, either in the offences, or the punishments; and a very large
discretion must unavoidably be vested in the court of impeachments, as to
both. Any attempt to define the offences, or to affix to every grade of
distinction its appropriate measure of punishment, would probably tend to
more injustice and inconvenience, than it would correct; and perhaps would
render the power at once inefficient and unwieldy. The discretion, then, if
confided at all, being peculiarly subject to abuse, and connecting itself
with state parties, and state contentions, and state animosities, it was
deemed most advisable by the convention, that the power of the senate to
inflict punishment should merely reach the right and qualifications to
office; and thus take away the temptation in factious times to sacrifice
good and great men upon the altar of party. History
</p>
<p>
 had sufficiently admonished them, that the power of impeachment had been
thus mischievously and inordinately applied in other ages; and it was not
safe to disregard those lessons, which it had left for our instruction,
written not unfrequently in blood. Lord Strafford, in the reign of Charles
the First, and Lord Stafford, in the reign of Charles the Second, were both
convicted, and punished capitally by the house of lords; and both have been
supposed to have been rather victims to the spirit of the times, than
offenders meriting such high punishments.
 <sup>
  <a href="#135">
   135
  </a>
 </sup>
 And other cases have occurred,
in which whatever may have been the demerits of the accused, his final
overthrow has been the result of political resentments and hatreds, far
more than of any desire to promote public justice.
 <sup>
  <a href="#136">
   136
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 784.
 </b>
 There is wisdom, and sound policy, and intrinsic
justice in this
separation of the offence, at least so far, as the jurisdiction and trial
are concerned, into its proper elements, bringing the political part under
the power of the political department of the government, and retaining the
civil part for presentment and trial in the ordinary forum. A jury might
well be entrusted with the latter; while the former should meet its
appropriate trial and punishment before the senate. If it should be asked,
why separate trials should thus be successively had; and why, if a
conviction should take place in a court of law, that court might not be
entrusted with the power to pronounce a removal from office, and the
disqualification to office, as a part of its sentence, the answer has been
already given in the
</p>
<p>
 reasoning against vesting any court of law with merely political functions.
In the ordinary course of the administration of criminal justice, no court
is authorized to remove, or disqualify an offender, as a part of its
regular judgment. If it results at all, it results as a consequence, and
not as a part of the sentence. But it may be properly urged, that the
vesting of such a high and delicate power, to be exercised by a court of
law at its discretion, would, in relation to the distinguished
functionaries of the government, be peculiarly unfit and inexpedient. What
could be more embarrassing, than for a court of law to pronounce for a
removal upon the mere ground of political usurpation, or malversation in
office, admitting of endless varieties, from the slightest guilt up to the
most flagrant corruption? Ought a president to be removed from office at
the mere will of a court for political misdemeanours? Is not a political
body, like the senate, from its superior information in regard to executive
functions, far better qualified to judge, how far the public weal might be
promoted by such a punishment in a given case, than a mere juridical
tribunal? Suppose the senate should still deem the judgment irregular, or
unjustifiable, how is the removal to take effect, and how is it to be
enforced? A separation of the removing power altogether from the appointing
power might create many practical difficulties, which ought not, except
upon the most urgent reasons, to be introduced into matters of government.
Without attempting to maintain, that the difficulties would be insuperable,
it is sufficient to show, that they might be highly inconvenient in
practice.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 785.
 </b>
 It does not appear from the Journal of the Convention,
that the
provision thus limiting the sentence upon impeachments to removal and
disqualifica-
</p>
<p>
 tion from office, attracted much attention, until a late period of its
deliberations.
 <sup>
  <a href="#137">
   137

 The adoption of it was not, however, without some
difference of opinion; for it passed only by the vote of seven states
against three.
 <sup>
  <a href="#138">
   138

 The reasons, on which this opposition was founded, do not
appear; and in the state conventions no doubt of the propriety of the

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 786.
 </b>
 In order to complete our review of the constitutional
provisions on
the subject of impeachments, it is necessary to ascertain, who are the
persons liable to be impeached; and what are impeachable offences. By some
strange inadvertence, this part of the constitution has been taken from its
natural connexion, and with no great propriety arranged under that head,
which embraces the organization, and rights, and duties of the executive
department. To prevent the necessity of again recurring to this subject,
the general method prescribed in these commentaries will, in this instance,
be departed from, and the only remaining provision on impeachments be here
introduced.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 787.
 </b>
 The fourth section of the second article is as follows: "The
president, vice-president, and all civil officers of the United States,
shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of,
treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours."
 <sup>
  <a href="#139">
   139
  </a>
 </sup>
 <b>
  § 788.
 </b>
 From this clause it appears, that the remedy
</p>
<p>
 by impeachment is strictly confined to civil officers of the United States,
including the president and vicepresident. In this respect, it differs
materially from the law and practice of Great-Britain. In that kingdom, all
the king's subjects, whether peers or commoners, are impeachable in
parliament; though it is asserted, that commoners cannot now be impeached
for capital offences, but for misdemeanours only.
 <sup>
  <a href="#140">
   140
  </a>
 </sup>
 Such kind of
misdeeds, however, as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of
high offices of trust, are the most proper, and have been the most usual
grounds for this kind of prosecution in parliament.
 <sup>
  <a href="#141">
   141
  </a>
 </sup>
 There seems a
peculiar propriety, in a republican government at least, in confining the
impeaching power to persons holding office. In such a government all the
citizens are equal, and ought to have the same security of a trial by jury
for all crimes and offences laid to their charge, when not holding any
official character. To subject them to impeachment would not only be
extremely oppressive and expensive, but would endanger their lives and
liberties, by exposing them against their wills to persecution for their
conduct in exercising their political rights and privileges. Dear as the
trial by jury justly is in civil cases, its value, as a protection against
the resentment and violence of rulers and factions in criminal
prosecutions, makes it inestimable. It is there, and there only, that a
citizen, in the sympathy, the impartiality, the intelligence, and
incorruptible integrity of his fellows, impanelled to try the accusation,
may indulge a well-founded confidence to sustain and cheer him. If he
should choose
</p>
<p>
 to accept office, he would voluntarily incur all the additional
responsibility growing out of it. If impeached for his conduct, while in
office, he could not justly complain, since he was placed in that
predicament by his own choice; and in accepting office he submitted to all
the consequences. Indeed, the moment it was decided, that the judgment upon
impeachments should be limited to removal and disqualification from office,
it followed, as a natural result, that it ought not to reach any but
officers of the United States. It seems to have been the original object of
the friends of the national government to confine it to these limits; for
in the original resolutions proposed to the convention, and in all the
subsequent proceedings, the power was expressly limited to national
officers.

<p>
 <b>
  § 789.
 </b>
 Who are "civil officers," within the meaning of this
constitutional
provision, is an inquiry, which naturally presents itself; and the answer
cannot, perhaps, be deemed settled by any solemn adjudication. The term
"civil" has various significations. It is sometimes used in
contradistinction to barbarous, or savage, to indicate a state of society
reduced to order and regular government. Thus, we speak of civil life,
civil society, civil government, and civil liberty; in which it is nearly
equivalent in meaning to political.
 <sup>
  <a href="#143">
   143
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is sometimes used in
contradistinction to criminal, to indicate the private rights and remedies
of men, as members of the community, in contrast to those, which are
public, and relate to the government. Thus, we speak of civil process and
criminal process, civil jurisdiction and
</p>
<p>
 criminal jurisdiction. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to
military or ecclesiastical, to natural or foreign. Thus, we speak of a
civil station, as opposed to a military or ecclesiastical station; a civil
death, as opposed to a natural death; a civil war, as opposed to a foreign
war. The sense, in which the term is used in the constitution, seems to be
in contradistinction to military, to indicate the rights and duties
relating to citizens generally, in contradistinction to those of persons
engaged in the land or naval service of the government. It is in this
sense, that Blackstone speaks of the laity in England, as divided into
three distinct states; the civil, the military, and the maritime; the two
latter embracing the land and naval forces of the government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#144">
   144
  </a>
 </sup>
 And in the
same sense the expenses of the civil list of officers are spoken of, in
contradistinction to those of the army and navy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#145">
   145

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 790.
 </b>
 All officers of the United States, therefore, who hold their
appointments under the national government, whether their duties are
executive or judicial, in the highest or in the lowest departments of the
government, with the exception of officers in the army and navy, are
properly civil officers within the meaning of the constitution, and liable
to impeachment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#146">
   146
  </a>
 </sup>
 The reason for excepting military and naval officers
is, that they are subject to trial and punishment according to a peculiar
military code, the laws, rules, and usages of war. The very nature and
efficiency of military duties and discipline require this summary and
exclusive jurisdiction; and the promptitude of its operations are not only
better suited to the notions of military men;
</p>
<p>
 but they deem their honour and their reputation more safe in the hands of
their brother officers, than in any merely civil tribunal. Indeed, in
military and naval affairs it is quite clear, that the senate could
scarcely possess competent knowledge or experience to decide upon the acts
of military men; so much are these acts to be governed by mere usage, and
custom, by military discipline, and military discretion, that the
constitution has wisely committed the whole trust to the decision of
courts-martial.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 791.
 </b>
 A question arose upon an impeachment before the senate
in 1799,
whether a senator was a civil officer of the United States, within the
purview of the constitution; and it was decided by the senate, that he was
not;
 <sup>
  <a href="#147">
   147

 </sup>
 and the like principle must apply to the members of the house of
representatives. This decision, upon which the senate itself was greatly
divided, seems not to have been quite satisfactory (as it may be gathered)
to the minds of some learned commentators.
 <sup>
  <a href="#148">
   148
  </a>
 </sup>
 The reasoning, by which it
was sustained in the senate, does not appear, their deliberations having
been private. But it was probably held, that "civil officers of the United
States" meant such, as derived their appointment from, and under the
national government, and not those persons, who, though members of the
government, derived their appointment from the states, or the people of the
states. In this view, the enumeration of the president and vice president,
as impeachable officers, was indispensable; for they derive, or may derive,
their
</p>
<p>
 office from a source paramount to the national government. And the clause
of the constitution, now under consideration, does not even affect to
consider them officers of the United States. It says, "the president,
vice-president, and all civil officers (not all other civil officers) shall
be removed," &amp;c. The language of the clause, therefore, would rather lead
to the conclusion, that they were enumerated, as contradistinguished from,
rather than as included in the description of, civil officers of the United
States. Other clauses of the constitution would seem to favour the same
result; particularly the clause, respecting appointment of officers of the
United States by the executive, who is to "commission all the officers of
the United States;" and the 6th section of the first article, which
declares, that "no person, holding any office under the United States,
shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office;"  and
the first section of the second article, which declares, that "no senator
or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the
United States, shall be appointed an elector."

 It is far from being
certain, that the convention itself ever contemplated, that senators or
representatives should be subjected to impeachment;
 <sup>
  <a href="#150">

 and it is very far
from being clear, that such a subjection would have been either politic or
desirable.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 792.
 </b>
 The reasoning of the Federalist on this subject, in
answer to some
objections to vesting the trial of impeachments in the senate, does not
lead to the conclusion, that the learned author thought the senators liable
to impeachment. Some parts of it would rather
</p>
<p>
 incline the other way. "The convention might with propriety," it is said,
"have meditated the punishment of the executive for a deviation from the
instructions of the senate, or a want of integrity in the conduct of the
negotiations committed to him. They might also have had in view the
punishment of a few leading individuals in the senate, who should have
prostituted their influence in that body, as the mercenary instruments of
foreign corruption. But they could not with more, or with equal propriety,
have contemplated the impeachment and punishment of two-thirds of the
senate, consenting to an improper treaty, than of a majority of that, or of
the other branch of the legislature, consenting to a pernicious or
unconstitutional law; a principle, which I believe has never been admitted
into any government," &amp;c. "And yet, what reason is there, that a majority
of the house of representatives, sacrificing the interests of the society
by an unjust and tyrannical act of legislation, should escape with
impunity, more than two-thirds of the senate sacrificing the same interests
in an injurious treaty with a foreign power? The truth is, that in all such
cases, it is essential to the freedom, and to the necessary independence of
the deliberations of the body, that the members of it should be exempt from
punishment for acts done in a collective capacity; and the security to the
society must depend on the care, which is taken, to confide the trust to
proper hands; to make it their interest to execute it with fidelity; and to
make it as difficult, as possible, for them to combine in any interest,
opposite to that of the public good."
 <sup>
  <a href="#151">
   151
  </a>
 </sup>
 And it is certain, that in some of
the state conventions the members of congress were admitted by the friends
of
</p>
<p>
 resort may be had to the constitution itself; but for the definition of
bribery, resort is naturally and necessarily had to the common law; for
that, as the common basis of our jurisprudence, can alone furnish the
proper exposition of the nature and limits of this offence. The only
practical question is, what are to be deemed high crimes and misdemeanours?
Now, neither the constitution, nor any statute of the United States has in
any manner defined any crimes, except treason and bribery, to be high
crimes and misdemeanours, and as such impeachable. In what manner, then,
are they to be ascertained? Is the silence of the statute book to be deemed
conclusive in favour of the party, until congress have made a legislative
declaration and enumeration of the offences, which shall be deemed high
crimes and misdemeanours? If so, then, as has been truly remarked,
 <sup>
  <a href="#154">
   154
  </a>
 </sup>
 the
power of impeachment, except as to the two expressed cases, is a complete
nullity; and the party is wholly dispunishable, however enormous may be his
corruption or criminality.
 <sup>
  <a href="#155">
   155
  </a>
 </sup>
 It will not be sufficient to say, that in
the cases, where any offence is punished by any statute of the United
States, it may, and ought to be, deemed an impeachable offence. It is not
every
</p>
<p>
 offence, that by the constitution is so impeachable. It must not only be an
offence, but a high crime and misdemeanour. Besides; there are many most
flagrant offences, which, by the statutes of the United States, are
punishable only, when committed in special places, and within peculiar
jurisdictions, as, for instance, on the high seas, or in forts, navy yards,
and arsenals ceded to the United States. Suppose the offence is committed
in some other, than these privileged places, or under circumstances not
reached by any statute of the United States, would it be impeachable?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 795.
 </b>
 Again; there are many offences, purely political, which
have been
held to be within the reach of parliamentary impeachments, not one of which
is in the slightest manner alluded to in our statute book. And, indeed,
political offences are of so various and complex a character, so utterly
incapable of being defined, or classified, that the task of positive
legislation would be impracticable, if it were not almost absurd to attempt
it. What, for instance, could positive legislation do in cases of
impeachment like the charges against Warren Hastings, in 1788? Resort,
then, must be had either to parliamentary practice, and the common law, in
order to ascertain, what are high crimes and misdemeanours; or the whole
subject must be left to the arbitrary discretion of the senate, for the
time being. The latter is so incompatible with the genius of our
institutions, that no lawyer or statesman would be inclined to countenance
so absolute a despotism of opinion and practice, which might make that a
crime at one time, or in one person, which would be deemed innocent at
another time, or in another person. The only safe guide in such cases must
be the common law, which is the guardian at once of private rights and
public liberties
</p>
<p>
 And however much it may fall in with the political theories of certain
statesmen and jurists, to deny the existence of a common law belonging to,
and applicable to the nation in ordinary cases, no one has as yet been bold
enough to assert, that the power of impeachment is limited to offences
positively defined in the statute book of the Union, as impeachable high
crimes and misdemeanours.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 796.
 </b>
 The doctrine, indeed, would be truly alarming, that the
common law
did not regulate, interpret, and control the powers and duties of the court
of impeachment. What, otherwise, would become of the rules of evidence, the
legal notions of crimes, and the applicationof principles of public or
municipal jurisprudence to the charges against the accused? It would be a
most extraordinary anomaly, that while every citizen of every state,
originally composing the Union, would be entitled to the common law, as his
birth-right, and at once his protector and guide; as a citizen of the
Union, or an officer of the Union, he would be subjected to no law, to no
principles, to no rules of evidence. It is the boast of English
jurisprudence, and without it the power of impeachment would be an
intolerable grievance, that in trials by impeachment the law differs not in
essentials from criminal prosecutions before inferior courts. The same
rules of evidence, the same legal notions of crimes and punishments
prevail. For impeachments are not framed to alter the law; but to carry it
into more effectual execution, where it might be obstructed by the
influence of too powerful delinquents, or not easily discerned in the
ordinary course of jurisdiction, by reason of the peculiar quality of the
alleged crimes.
 <sup>
  <a href="#156">
   156
  </a>
 </sup>
 Those, who
</p>
<p>
 believe, that the common law, so far as it is applicable, constitutes a
part of the law of the United States in their sovereign character, as a
nation, not as a source of jurisdiction, but as a guide, and check, and
expositor in the administration of the rights, duties, and jurisdiction
conferred by the constitution and laws, will find no difficulty in
affirming the same doctrines to be applicable to the senate, as a court of
impeachments. Those, who denounce the common law, as having any application
or existence in regard to the national government, must be necessarily
driven to maintain, that the power of impeachment is, until congress shall
legislate, a mere nullity, or that it is despotic, both in its reach, and
in its proceedings.
 <sup>
  <a href="#157">
   157
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is remarkable, that the first congress, assembled
in October, 1774, in their famous declaration of the rights of the
colonies, asserted, "that the respective colonies are entitled to the
common law of England;" and "that they are entitled to the benefit of such
of the English statutes, as existed at the time of their colonization, and
which they have by experience respectively found to be applicable to their
several local and other circumstances."
 <sup>
  <a href="#158">
   158
  </a>
 </sup>
 It would be singular enough, if,
in framing a national government, that common law, so justly dear to the
colonies, as their guide and protection, should cease to have any exist-
</p>
<p>
 ence, as applicable to the powers, rights, and privileges of the people, or
the obligations, and duties, and powers of the departments of the national
government. If the common law has no existence, as to the Union, as a rule
or guide, the whole proceedings are completely at the arbitrary pleasure of
the government, and its functionaries in all its departments.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 797.
 </b>
 Congress have unhesitatingly adopted the conclusion, that no
previous statute is necessary to authorize an impeachment for any official
misconduct; and the rules of proceeding, and the rules of evidence, as well
as the principles of decision, have been uniformly regulated by the known
doctrines of the common law and parliamentary usage. In the few cases of
impeachment, which have hitherto been tried, no one of the charges has
rested upon any statutable misdemeanours.
 <sup>
  <a href="#159">
   159
  </a>
 </sup>
 It seems, then, to be the
settled doctrine of the high court of impeachment, that though the common
law cannot be a foundation of a jurisdiction not given by the constitution,
or laws, that jurisdiction, when given, attaches, and is to be exercised
according to the rules of the common law; and that, what are, and what are
not high crimes and misdemeanours, is to be ascertained by a recurrence to
that great basis of American jurisprudence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#160">
   160
  </a>
 </sup>
 The reasoning, by which the
</p>
<p>
 power of the house of representatives to punish for contempts, (which are
breaches of privileges, and offences not defined by any positive laws,) has
been upheld by the Supreme Court, stands upon similar grounds; for if the
house had no jurisdiction to punish for contempts, until the acts had been
previously defined, and ascertained by positive law, it is clear, that the
process of arrest would be illegal.
 <sup>
  <a href="#161">
   161

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 798.
 </b>
 In examining the parliamentary history of impeachments,
it will be
found, that many offences, not easily definable by law, and many of a
purely political character, have been deemed high crimes and misdemeanours
worthy of this extraordinary remedy. Thus, lord chancellors, and judges,
and other magistrates, have not only been impeached for bribery, and acting
grossly contrary to the duties of their office; but for misleading their
sovereign by unconstitutional opinions, and for attempts to subvert the
fundamental laws, and introduce arbitrary power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#162">
   162
  </a>
 </sup>
 So, where a lord
chancellor has been thought to have put the great seal to an ignominious
treaty; a lord admiral to have neglected the safe-guard of the sea; an
ambassador to have betrayed his trust; a privy counsellor to have
propounded, or supported pernicious and dishonourable measures; or a
confidential adviser of his sovereign to have obtained exorbitant grants,
or incompatible employments; -- these have been all deemed impeachable
</p>
<p>
 offences.
 <sup>
  <a href="#163">
   163
  </a>
 </sup>
 Some of the offences, indeed, for which persons were
impeached in the early ages of British jurisprudence, would now seem harsh
and severe; but perhaps they were rendered necessary by existing
corruptions, and the importance of suppressing a spirit of favouritism, and
court intrigue. Thus, persons have been impeached for giving bad counsel to
the king; advising a prejudicial peace; enticing the king to act against
the advice of parliament; purchasing offices; giving medicine to the king
without advice of physicians; preventing other persons from giving counsel
to the king, except in their presence; and procuring exorbitant personal
grants from the king.
 <sup>
  <a href="#164">
   164
  </a>
 </sup>
 But others, again, were founded in the most
salutary public justice; such as impeachments for malversations and
neglects in office; for encouraging pirates; for official oppression,
extortions, and deceits; and especially for putting good magistrates out of
office, and advancing bad.
 <sup>
  <a href="#165">
   165
  </a>
 </sup>
 One cannot but be struck, in this slight
enumeration, with the utter unfitness of the common tribunals of justice to
take cognizance of such offences; and with the entire propriety of
confiding the jurisdiction over them to a tribunal capable of
understanding, and reforming, and scrutinizing the polity of the state,
 <sup>
  <a href="#166">
   166
  </a>
 </sup>
 and of sufficient dignity to maintain the independence and reputation of
worthy public officers.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 799
 </b>
 . Another inquiry, growing out of this subject, is,
whether, under
the constitution, any acts are impeachable, except such, as are committed
under colour of office; and whether the party can be impeached
</p>
<p>
 therefor, after he has ceased to hold office. A learned commentator seems
to have taken it for granted, that the liability to impeachment extends to
all, who have been, as well as to all, who are in public office.1    Upon
the other point his language is as follows: "The legitimate causes of
impeachment have been already briefly noticed. They can have reference only
to public character, and official duty. The words of the text are,
'treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanours.' The treason
contemplated must be against the United States. In general, those offences,
which may be committed equally by a private person, as a public officer,
are not the subjects of impeachment. Murder, burglary, robbery, and indeed
all offences not immediately connected with office, except the two
expressly mentioned, are left to the ordinary course of judicial
proceeding; and neither house can regularly inquire into them, except for
the purpose of expelling a member."
 <sup>
  <a href="#167">
   167
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 800.
 </b>
 It does not appear, that either of these points has
been judicially
settled by the court having, properly, cognizance of them. In the case of
William Blount, the plea of the defendant expressly put both of them, as
exceptions to the jurisdiction, alleging, that, at the time of the
impeachment, he, Blount, was not a senator, (though he was at the time of
the charges laid against him,) and that he was not charged by the articles
of impeachment with having committed any crime, or misdemeanour, in the
execution of any civil office held under the United States; nor with any
malconduct in a civil office, or abuse of any public trust in the
</p>
<p>
 execution thereof.
 <sup>
  <a href="#168">
   168
  </a>
 </sup>
 The decision, however, turned upon another point,
viz., that a senator was not an impeachable officer.
 <sup>
  <a href="#169">
   169
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 801.
 </b>
 As it is declared in one clause of the constitution, that
"judgment, in cases of impeachment, shall not extend further, than a
removal from office, and disqualification to hold any office of honour,
trust, or profit, under the United States;" and in another clause, that
"the president, vice president, and all civil officers of the United
States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of,
treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours;" it would seem to
follow, that the senate, on the conviction, were bound, in all cases, to
enter a judgment of removal from office, though it has a discretion, as to
inflicting the punishment of disqualification.
 <sup>
  <a href="#170">
   170
  </a>
 </sup>
 If, then, there must be
a judgment of removal from office, it would seem to follow, that the
constitution contemplated, that the party was still in office at the time
of the impeachment. If he was not, his offence was still liable to be tried
and punished in the ordinary tribunals of justice. And it might be argued
with some force, that it would be a vain exercise of authority to try a
delinquent for an impeachable offence, when the most important object, for
which the remedy was given, was no longer necessary, or attainable. And
although a judgment of disqualification might still be pronounced, the
language of the constitution
</p>
<p>
 may create some doubt, whether it can be pronounced without being coupled
with a removal from office.
 <sup>
  <a href="#171">
   171
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is also much force in the remark, that
an impeachment is a proceeding purely of a political nature. It is not so
much designed to punish an offender, as to secure the state against gross
official misdemeanors. It touches neither his person, nor his property; but
simply divests him of his political capacity.
 <sup>
  <a href="#172">
   172
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 802.
 </b>
 The other point is one of more difficulty. In the
argument upon
Blount's impeachment, it was pressed with great earnestness, that there is
not a syllable in the constitution, which confines impeachments to official
acts, and it is against the plainest dictates of common sense, that such
restraint should be imposed upon it. Suppose a judge should countenance, or
aid insurgents in a meditated conspiracy or insurrection against the
government. This is not a judicial act; and yet it ought certainly to be
impeachable. He may be called upon to try the very persons, whom he has
aided.
 <sup>
  <a href="#173">
   173
  </a>
 </sup>
 Suppose a judge or other officer to receive a bribe not connected
with his judicial office; could he be entitled to any public confidence?
Would not these reasons for his removal be just as strong, as if it were a
case of an official bribe? The argument on the other side was, that the
power of impeachment was strictly confined to civil officers of the United
States, and this necessarily implied, that it must be limited to malconduct
in office.

 It is not intended to express any opinion in these

to which is the true exposition of the constitution on the points above
stated. They are brought before the learned reader, as matters still sub
judice, the final decision of which may be reason ably left to the high
tribunal, constituting the court of impeachment, when the occasion shall
arise;
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 804.
 </b>
 This subject may be concluded by a summary statement of
the mode of
proceeding in the institution and trial of impeachments, as it is of rare
occurrence, and not governed by the formalities of the ordinary
prosecutions in courts at law.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 805.
 </b>
 When, then, an officer is known or suspected to be guilty of
malversation in office, some member of the house of representatives usually
brings forward a resolution to accuse the party, or for the appointment of
a committee, to consider and report upon the charges laid against him. The
latter is the ordinary course; and the report of the committee usually
contains, if adverse to the party, a statement of the charges, and
recommends a resolution, that he be impeached) therefor. If the resolution
is adopted by the house, a committee is then appointed to impeach the party
at the bar of the senate, and to state, that the articles against him will
be exhibited in due time, and made good before the senate; and to demand,
that the senate take order for the appearance of the party to answer to the
impeach-
</p>
<p>
 ment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#177">
   177
  </a>
 </sup>
 This being accordingly done, the senate signify their willingness
to take such order; and articles are then prepared by a committee, under
the direction of the house of representatives, which, when reported to, and
approved by the house, are then presented in the like manner to the senate;
and a committee of managers are appointed to conduct the impeachment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#178">
   178
  </a>
 </sup>
 As
soon as the articles are thus presented, the senate issue a process,
summoning the party to appear at a given day before them, to answer the
articles.
 <sup>
  <a href="#179">

 The process is served by the sergeant-at-arms of the senate,
and due return is made thereof under oath.

 The articles thus exhibited need not, and indeed do
not, pursue the
strict form and accuracy of an indictment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#180">
   180
  </a>
 </sup>
 They are sometimes quite
general in the form of the allegations; but always contain, or ought to
contain, so much certainty, as to enable the party to put himself upon the
proper defence, and also, in case of an acquittal, to avail himself of it,
as a bar to another impeachment. Additional articles may be exhibited,
perhaps, at any stage of the prosecution.

 <b>
  § 807.
 </b>
 When the return day of the process for appearance has
arrived, the
senate resolve themselves into a court of impeachment, and the senators are
at that time, or before, solemnly sworn, or affirmed, to do impartial
justice upon the impeachment, according to the constitution and laws of the
United States. The
</p>
<p>
 person impeached is then called to appear and answer the articles. If he
does not appear in person, or by attorney, his default is recorded, and the
senate may proceed ex parte to the trial of the impeachment. If he does
appear in person, or by attorney, his appearance is recorded. Counsel for
the parties are admitted to appear, and to be heard upon an impeachment.

<p>
 <b>
  § 808.
 </b>
 When the party appears, he is entitled to be furnished
with a copy
of the articles of impeachment, and time is allowed him to prepare his
answer thereto. The answer, like the articles, is exempted from the
necessity of observing great strictness of form. The party may plead, that
he is not guilty, as to part, and make a further defence, as to the
residue; or he may, in a few words, saving all exceptions, deny the whole
charge or charges;
 <sup>
  <a href="#183">
   183
  </a>
 </sup>
 or he may plead specially, in justification or
excuse of the supposed offences, all the circumstance attendant upon the
case. And he is also indulged with the liberty of offering argumentative
reasons, as well as facts, against the charges in support, and as part, of
his answer, to repel them. It is usual to give a full and particular answer
separately to each article of the accusation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#184">
   184
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 809.
 </b>
 When the answer is prepared and given in, the next regular
proceeding is, for the house of representatives to file a replication to
the answer in writing, in substance denying the truth and validity of the
defence stated in the answer, and averring the truth and sufficiency of the
charges, and the readiness of the house to prove them at such convenient
time and place,
</p>
<p>
 as shall be appointed for that purpose by the senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#185">
   185
  </a>
 </sup>
 A time is then
assigned for the trial; and the senate, at that period or before, adjust
the preliminaries and other proceedings proper to be had, before and at the
trial, by fixed regulations; which are made known to the house of
representatives, and to the party accused.
 <sup>
  <a href="#186">
   186
  </a>
 </sup>
 On the day appointed for the
trial, the house of representatives appear at the bar of the senate, either
in a body, or by the managers selected for that purpose, to proceed with
the trial.
 <sup>
  <a href="#187">
   187
  </a>
 </sup>
 Process to compel the attendance of witnesses is previously
issued at the request of either party, by order of the senate; and at the
time and place appointed, they are bound to appear and give testimony. On
the day of trial, the parties being ready, the managers to conduct the
prosecution open it on behalf of the house of representatives, one or more
of them delivering an explanatory speech, either of the whole charges, or
of one or more of them. The proceedings are then conducted substantially,
as they are upon common judicial trials, as to the admission or rejection
of testimony, the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, the rules
of evidence, and the legal doctrines, as to crimes and misdemeanours.
 <sup>
  <a href="#188">
   188
  </a>
 </sup>
 When the whole evidence has been gone through, and the parties on each side
have been fully heard, the senate then proceed to the consideration of the
case. If any debates arise, they are conducted in secret; if none arise, or
after they are ended, a day is assigned for a final public decision by yeas
and nays upon each separate charge in the articles of impeachment. When the
court is assembled for this purpose, the question is
</p>
<p>
 propounded to each member of the senate by name, by the president of the
senate, in the following manner, upon each article, the same being first
read by the secretary of the senate. "Mr. -- , how say you, is the
respondent guilty, or not guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour, as
charged in the article of impeachment?" Whereupon the member rises in his
place, and answers guilty, or not guilty, as his opinion is. If upon no one
article two thirds of the senate decide, that the party is guilty, he is
then entitled to an acquittal, and is declared accordingly to be acquitted
by the president of the senate. If he is convicted of all, or any of the
articles, the senate then proceed to fix, and declare the proper
punishment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#189">

 The pardoning power of the president does not, as will be
presently seen, extend to judgments upon impeachment; and hence, when once
pronounced, they become absolute and irreversible.

 Having thus gone through the whole subject of impeachments, it only
remains to observe, that a close survey of the system, unless we are
egregiously deceived, will completely demonstrate the wisdom of the
arrangements made in every part of it. The jurisdiction to impeach is
placed, where it should be, in the possession and power of the immediate
representatives of the people. The trial is before a body of great dignity,
and ability, and independence, possessing the requisite knowledge and
firmness to act with vigour,
</p>
<p>
 and to decide with impartiality upon the charges. The persons subjected to
the trial are officers of the national government; and the offences are
such, as may affect the rights, duties, and relations of the party accused
to the public in his political or official character, either directly or
remotely. The general rules of law and evidence, applicable to common
trials, are interposed, to protect the party against the exercise of wanton
oppression, and arbitrary power. And the final judgment is confined to a
removal from, and disqualification for, office; thus limiting the
punishment to such modes of redress, as are peculiarly fit for a political
tribunal to administer, and as will secure the public against political
injuries. In other respects the offence is left to be disposed of by the
common tribunals of justice, according to the laws of the land, upon an
indictment found by a grand jury, and a trial by a jury of peers, before
whom the party is to stand for his final deliverance, like his fellow
citizens.

 <b>
  § 811.
 </b>
 In respect to the impeachment of the president, and
vice president,
it may be remarked, that they are, upon motives of high state policy, made
liable to impeachment, while they yet remain in office. In England the
constitutional maxim is, that the king can do no wrong. His ministers and
advisers may be impeached and punished; but he is, by his prerogative,
placed above all personal amenability to the laws for his acts.
 <sup>
  <a href="#191">
   191
  </a>
 </sup>
 In some
of the state constitutions, no explicit provision is made for the
impeachment of the chief magistrate; and in Delaware and Virginia, he was
not (under their old constitutions) impeachable, until he was out of
office.
 <sup>
  <a href="#192">
   192
  </a>
 </sup>
 So that no immediate remedy in
</p>
<p>
 those states was provided for gross malversations and corruptions in
office; and the only redress lay in the elective power, followed up by
prosecutions after the party had ceased to hold his office. Yet cases may
be imagined, where a momentary delusion might induce a majority of the
people to re-elect a corrupt chief magistrate; and thus the remedy would be
at once distant and uncertain. The provision in the constitution of the
United States, on the other hand, holds out a deep and immediate
responsibility, as a check upon arbitrary power; and compels the chief
magistrate, as well as the humblest citizen, to bend to the majesty of the
laws.

106.--Montesquieu seems to have been decidedly of opinion, that a senate
ought to be chosen for life, as was the custom at Rome, at Sparta, and even
at Athens.* It is well known, that this was Gen. Hamilton's opinion, or
rather his proposition was, that the senators should be chosen to serve
during good behaviour. (Journ. of Convention, p. 130); North American
Review, Oct. 1827, p 266). It appears to have been that of Mr. Jay. (North
American Review, Oct. 1827, p. 263.) Mr. Madison's original opinion seems
to have been, to have a senate chosen for a longer term, than the house of
representatives.# But in the convention, it is said, that he was favourably
inclined to Mr. Hamilton's plan.+ In a question of so much difficulty andde
licacy, as the due formation of a government, it is not at all surprising,
that such opinions should have been held by them, and many others of the
purest and most enlightened patriots. They wished durability and success to
a republican government, and were, therefore, urgent to secure it against
the imbecility resulting from what they deemed too frequent changes in the
administration of its powers. To hold such opinions was not then deemed a
just matter of reproach, though from the practical operations of the
constitution they may now be deemed unsound.</li>

<li><a id="59"></a> In the ease of Mr. Lanman, a senator from Connecticut, a question
occurred, whether the state executive could make an appointment in the
recess of the state legislature in anticipation of the expiration of the
term of office of an existing senator. It was decided by the senate, that
he could not make such an appointment. The facts were, that Mr. Lanman's
term of service, as senator expired on the third of March, 1825. The
president had convoked the senator to meet on the fourth of March. The
governor of Connecticut in the recess of the legislature, (whose session
would be in May,) on the ninth of the preceding February appointed Mr.
Lanman, as senator, to sit in the senate after the third of March. The
senate, by a vote of 23 to 18, decided, that the appointment could not be
constitutionally made, until after the vacancy had actually occurred. See

curious circumstance in the history of congress, that the exercise of the
power of the vice president in defeating a bill for the apportionment of
representatives in 1792, has been censured, because such a bill seemed (if
any) almost exclusively fit for the house of representatives to decide
upon;* and that A like bill, to which the senate interposed a strong
opposition, in 1832, has been deemed by some of the states so
exceptionable, that this resistance has been thought worthy of high praise.
There is some danger in drawing conclusions from a single exercise of any
power against its general utility or policy.</li>

   It may be admitted, that a breach of duty is as
reprehensible in a
legislator, as in an executive, or judicial officer; but it does not
follow, that the same remedy should be applied in each case; or that a
remedy applicable to the one may not be unfit, or inconvenient in the
other. Senators and representatives are at short periods made responsible
to the people, and may be rejected by them. And for personal offences, not
purely political, they are responsible to the common tribunals of justice,
and the laws of the land. If a member of congress were liable to be
impeached for conduct in his legislative capacity, at the will of a
majority, it might furnish many pretexts for an irritated and predominant
faction to destroy the character, and intercept the influence of the wisest
and most exalted patriots, who were resisting their oppressions, or
developing their profligacy. It is, therefore, with great reason urged,
that a legislator should be above all fear and influence of this sort in
his public conduct. The impeachment of a legislator, for his official acts,
has hitherto been unacknowledged, as matter of right, in the annals of
England and America. A silence of this sort is conclusive, as to the state
of public opinion in relation to the impolicy and danger of conferring the
power.2 § 794.
   
   The next inquiry is, what are impeachable offences? They are
"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours." For the
definition of treason,</li>

<li><a id="153"></a> The arguments of counsel, for and against a senator's being an
impeachable officer, will be found at large, in the printed trial of
William Blount, on his impeachment. (Philad. 1799.)</li>
<li><a id="154"></a> 1 Rawle on the Constitution, ch. p. 273.</li>
<li><a id="155"></a> Upon the trial of Mr. Justice Chase, in 1805, it was contended in his
answer and defence, that no civil officer was impeachable, but "for
treason, bribery, corruption, or some high crime or misdemeanour,
consisting in some act done or omitted, in violation of law, forbidding or
commanding it." "Hence it clearly results, that in civil officer of the
United States can be impeached, except for some offence, for which he may
be indicted at law; and that no evidence can be received on an impeachment,
except such, as, on an indictment at law for the same offence, would be
admissible."* The same doctrine was insisted on by his counsel.# * 1 Chase's Trial, p. 47, 48. # 2 Chase's Trial, p. 9 to 18; 4 Elliot's Debates, 262.</li>

<li><a id="157"></a> It is not my design in this place to enter upon the discussion of the
much controverted question, whether the common law constitutes a part of
the national jurisprudence, on contradistinction to that of the states. The
learned reader will find the subject amply discussed in the works, to which
he has been already referred, viz. 1 Tuck. Black. Comm. App. Note E. p.
378, &amp;c.; in the Report of the Virginia Legislature of 1799, 1800; in Rawle
on the Constit. ch. 30, p. 258, &amp;c., and in Duponceau on Jurisdiction, and
the authorities there cited. 1 Kent. Comm. Lect. 16, p. 311 et esq.; North
American Review, July, 1825; Mr. Bayard's Speech, Debate on the Judiciary
in 1802, p. 372.</li>
<li><a id="158"></a> 1 Journal of Congress, Oct. 1774, p. 29.</li>
<li><a id="159"></a> It may be supposed, that the first charge in the articles of impeachment
against William Blount was a statutable offence; but on an accurate
examination of the act of congress, of 1794, it will be found not to have
been so.</li>
<li><a id="160"></a> See Jefferson's Manual, §53, title, Impeachment; Blount's Trial on
Impeachment, p. 29 to 31; Id. 75 to 80, (Philadelphia, 1799.) But see Id.
p. 42 to 46. -- In another clause of the constitution power is given to the
president to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United
States, except in cases of impeachment; thus showing, that impeachable
offences are deemed offences against the United Sates. If the senate may
then declare, what are offences against the United  States by recurrence to the common law, why may not the courts of the
United States, under the express delegation of jurisdiction over "all
crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the United States,"
by the act of 1789, ch. 20, §11, act in the same manner?</li>

William Blount was expelled from the senate a few day before this
impeachment, (being then a member,) and on that occasion he was, by a
resolution of the senate,* declared to be "guilty of a high misde- * Yeas, 25; Nay, 1.</li>

The offence charged was not defined by any statute of the United States. It
was for a attempt to seduce an United States' Indian interpreter from his
duty, and to alienate the affections and confidence of the Indians from the
public officers residing among them, &amp;c. Journ. of Senate, 8th July. 1797;
