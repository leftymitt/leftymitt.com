<p>
 § 870. THE seventh section of the first article treats of two
important
subjects, the right of originating revenue bills, and the nature and extent
of the president's negative upon the passing of laws.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 871.
 </b>
 The first clause declares -- "All bills for raising
revenue shall
originate in the house of representatives; but the senate may propose, or
concur with amendments, as on other bills." This provision, so far as it
regards the right to originate what are technically called "money bills,"
is, beyond all question, borrowed from the British house of commons, of
which it is the ancient and indisputable privilege and right, that all
grants of subsidies and parliamentary aids shall begin in their house, and
are first bestowed by them, although their grants are not effectual to all
intents and purposes, until they have the assent of the other two branches
of the legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#1">

  </a>
 </sup>
 The general reason given for this privilege of the
house of commons is, that the supplies are raised upon the body of the
people; and therefore it is proper, that they alone should have the right
of taxing themselves. And Mr. Justice Blackstone has very correctly
remarked, that this reason would be unanswerable, if the commons taxed none
but themselves. But it is notorious, that a very large share of property is
in possession of the lords; that this property is equally taxed, as the
property of the com-
</p>
<p>
 mons; and therefore the commons, not being the sole persons taxed, this
cannot be the reason of their having the sole right of raising and
modelling the supply. The true reason seems to be this. The lords being a
permanent hereditary body, created at pleasure by the king, are supposed
more liable to be influenced by the crown, and when once influenced, more
likely to continue so, than the commons, who are a temporary elective body,
freely nominated by the people. It would, therefore, be extremely dangerous
to give thelords any power of framing new taxes for the subject. It is
sufficient, that they have a power of rejecting, if they think the commons
too lavish or improvident in their grants.
 <sup>
  <a href="#2">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<b>
 § 872.
</b>
This seems a very just account of the matter, with
reference to the
spirit of the British constitution; though a different explanation has been
deduced from a historical review of the power. It has been asserted to have
arisen from the instructions from time to time given by the constituents of
the commons, (whether county, city, or borough,) as to the rates and
assessments, which they were respectively willing to bear and assent to;
and from the aggregate it was easy for the commons to ascertain the whole
amount, which the commonalty of the whole kingdom were willing to grant to
the king.
<sup>
 <a href="#3">
  3
 </a>
</sup>
Be this as it may, so jealous are the commons of this valuable
privilege, that herein they will not suffer the other house to exert any
power, but that of rejecting. They will not permit the least alteration or
amendment to be made by the lords to the mode of taxing the people by a
money bill; and under
<p>
 this appellation are included all bills, by which money is directed to be
raised upon the subject for any purpose, or in any shape whatsoever, either
for the exigencies of the government, and collected from the kingdom in
general, as the land tax, or for private benefit, and collected in any
particular district, as turnpikes, parish rates, and the like.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">
   4
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is
obvious, that this power might be capable of great abuse, if other bills
were tacked to such money bills; and accordingly it was found, that money
bills were sometimes tacked to favourite measures of the commons, with a
view to ensure their passage by the lords. This extraordinary use, or
rather perversion of the power, would, if suffered to grow into a common
practice, have completely destroyed the equilibrium of the British
constitution, and subjected both the lords and the king to the power of the
commons. Resistance was made from time to time to this unconstitutional
encroachment; and at length the lords, with a view to give permanent effect
to their own rights, hare made it a standing order to reject upon sight all
bills, that are tacked to money bills.
 <sup>
  <a href="#5">
   5
  </a>
 </sup>
 Thus, the privilege is maintained
on one side, and guarded against undue abuse on the other.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 873.
 </b>
 It will be at once perceived, that the same reasons do
not exist in
the same extent, for the same exclusive right in our house of
representatives in regard to money bills, as exist for such right in the
British house of commons. It may be fit, that it should possess the
exclusive right to originate money bills; since it may be presumed to
possess more ample means of local information, and it more directly
represents the opinions, feelings, and wishes of the people; and, being
</p>
<p>
 directly dependent upon them for support, it will be more watchful and
cautious in the imposition of taxes, than a body, which emanates
exclusively from the states in their sovereign political capacity.
 <sup>
  <a href="#6">
   6
  </a>
 </sup>
 But,
as the senators are in a just sense equally representatives of the people,
and do not hold their offices by a permanent or hereditary title, but
periodically return to the common mass of citizens;
 <sup>
  <a href="#7">
   7
  </a>
 </sup>
 and above all, as
direct taxes are, and must be, apportioned among the states according to
their federal population; and as all the states hare a distinct local
interest, both as to the amount and nature of all taxes of every sort,
which are to be levied, there seems a peculiar fitness in giving to the
senate a power to alter and amend, as well as to concur with, or reject all
money bills. The due influence of all the states is thus preserved; for
otherwise it might happen, from the overwhelming representation of some of
the large states, that taxes might be levied, which would bear with
peculiar severity upon the interests, either agricultural, commercial, or
manufacturing, of others being the minor states; and thus the equilibrium
intended by the constitution, as well of power, as of interest, and
influence, might be practically subverted.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 874
 </b>
 There would also be no small inconvenience in excluding
the senate
from the exercise of this power of amendment and alteration; since if any,
the slightest modification were required in such a bill to make it either
palatable or just, the senate would be compelled to reject it, although an
amendment of a single line
</p>
<p>
 might make it entirely acceptable to both houses.
 <sup>
  <a href="#8">
   8
  </a>
 </sup>
 Such a practical
obstruction to the legislation of a free government would far outweigh any
supposed theoretical advantages from the possession or exercise of an
exclusive power by the house of representatives. Infinite perplexities, and
misunderstandings, and delays would clog the most wholesome legislation.
Even the annual appropriation bills might be in danger of a miscarriage on
these accounts; and the most painful dissensions might be introduced.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 875.
 </b>
 Indeed, of so little importance has the exclusive
possession of
such a power been thought in the state governments, that some of the state
constitutions make no difference, as to the power of each branch of the
legislature to originate money bills. Most of them contain a provision
similar to that in the constitution of the United States; and in those
states, where the exclusive power formerly existed, as, for instance, in
Virginia and South-Carolina, it was a constant source of difficulties and
contentions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#9">
   9
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the revised constitution of South-Carolina, (in 1790,)
the provision was altered, so as to conform to the clause in the
constitution of the United States.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 876.
 </b>
 The clause seems to have met with no serious opposition
in any of
the state conventions; and indeed could scarcely be expected to meet with
any opposition, except in Virginia; since the other states were well
satisfied with the principle adopted in their own state constitutions; and
in Virginia the clause created but little debate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#10">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 877.
 </b>
 What bills are properly "bills for raising revenue," in
the sense
of the constitution, has been matter
</p>
<p>
 of some discussion. A learned commentator supposes, that every bill, which
indirectly or consequentially may raise revenue, is, within the sense of
the constitution, a revenue bill. He therefore thinks, that the bills for
establishing the post-office, and the mint, and regulating, the value of
foreign coin, belong to this class, and ought not to have originated (as in
fact they did) in the senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#11">
   11
  </a>
 </sup>
 But the practical construction of the
constitution has been against his opinion. And, indeed, the history of the
origin of the power, already suggested, abundantly proves, that it has been
confined to bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the words, and has
not been understood to extend to bills for other purposes, which may
incidentally create revenue.
 <sup>
  <a href="#12">
   12
  </a>
 </sup>
 No one supposes, that a bill to sell any of
the public lands, or to sell public stock, is a bill to raise revenue, in
the sense of the constitution. Much less would a bill be so deemed, which
merely regulated the value of foreign or domestic coins, or authorized a
discharge of insolvent debtors upon assignments of their estates to the
United States, giving a priority of payment to the United States in cases
of insolvency, although all of them might incidentally bring, revenue into
the treasury.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 878.
 </b>
 The next clause respects the power of the president to
approve, and
negative laws. In the convention there does not seem to have been much
diversity of opinion on the subject of the propriety of giving to the
president a negative on the laws. The principal points of discussion seem
to have been, whether the negative should be absolute, or qualified; and if
the latter, by what number of each house the bill should be subsequently
passed, in order to become a law; and
</p>
<p>
 whether the negative should in either case be exclusively vested in the
president alone, or in him jointly with some other department of the
government. The proposition of a qualified negative seems to have obtained
general, but not universal support, having been carried by the vote of
eight states against two.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">
   13
  </a>
 </sup>
 This being settled, the question, as to the
number, was at first unanimously carried in the affirmative in favour of
two thirds of each house; at a subsequent period it was altered to three
fourths by a vote of six states against four, one being divided; and it was
ultimately restored to the two thirds, without any apparent struggle.
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 An
effort was also made to unite the supreme national judiciary with the
executive in revising the laws, and exercising the negative. But it was
constantly resisted, being at first overruled by a vote of four states
against three, two being divided, and finally rejected by the vote of eight
states against three.
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 879.
 </b>
 Two points may properly arise upon this subject. First, the
propriety of vesting the power in the president; and secondly, the extent
of the legislative check, to prevent an undue exercise of it. The former
also admits of a double aspect, viz. whether the negative should be
absolute, or should be qualified. An absolute negative on the legislature
appears, at first, to be the natural defence, with which the executive
magistrate should be armed. But in a free government, it seems not
altogether safe, nor of itself a sufficient defence. On ordinary occasions,
it may not be exerted with the requisite firmness; and on
extraordinary-occasions, it may be perfidiously abused. It
</p>
<p>
 is true, that the defect of such an absolute negative has a tendency to
weaken the executive department. But this may be obviated, or at least
counterpoised, by other arrangements in the government; such as a qualified
connexion with the senate in making treaties and appointments, by which the
latter, being a stronger department, may be led to support the
constitutional rights of the former, without being too much detached from
its own legislative functions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#16">
   16
  </a>
 </sup>
 And the patronage of the executive has
also some tendency to create a counteracting influence in aid of his
independence. It is true, that in England an absolute negative is vested in
the king, as a branch of the legislative power; and he possesses the
absolute power of rejecting, rather than of resolving. And this is thought
by Mr. Justice Blackstone and others, to be a most important, and indeed
indispensable part of the royal prerogative, to guard against the
usurpations of the legislative authority.
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">
   17
  </a>
 </sup>
 Yet in point of fact this
negative of the king has not been once exercised since the year 1692;
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">
   18
  </a>
 </sup>
 a
fact, which can only be accounted for upon one of two suppositions, either
that the influence of the crown has prevented the passage of objectionable
measures, or that the exercise of the prerogative has become so odious,
that it has not been deemed safe to exercise it, except upon the most
pressing emergencies.
 <sup>
  <a href="#19">
   19
  </a>
 </sup>
 Probably both
</p>
<p>
 motives have alternately prevailed in regard to bills, which were
disagreeable to the crown;
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">
   20
  </a>
 </sup>
 though, for the last half century, the latter
has had the most uniform and decisive operation. As the house of commons
becomes more and more the representative of the popular opinion, the crown
will have less and less inducement to hazard its own influence by a
rejection of any favourite measure of the people. It will be more likely to
take the lead, and thus guide and moderate, instead of resisting the
commons. And, practically speaking, it is quite problematical, whether a
qualified negative may not hereafter in England become a more efficient
protection of the crown, than an absolute negative, which makes no appeal
to the other legislative bodies, and consequently compels the crown to bear
the exclusive odium of a rejection.
 <sup>
  <a href="#21">
   21
  </a>
 </sup>
 Be this as it may, the example of
England furnishes, on this point, no sufficient authority for America.  The
whole structure of our government is so entirely different, and the
elements, of which it is composed, are so dissimilar from that of England,
that no argument can be drawn from the practice of the latter, to assist us
in a just arrangement of the executive authority.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 880.
 </b>
 It has been observed by Mr. Chancellor Kent, with pithy
elegance,
that the peremptory veto of the Roman Tribunes, who were placed at the door
of the Roman senate, would not be reconcileable with the
</p>
<p>
 spirit of deliberation and independence, which distinguishes the councils
of modern times. The French constitution of 1791, a laboured and costly
fabric, on which the philosophers and statesmen of France exhausted all
their ingenuity, and which was prostrated in the dust in the course of one
year from its existence, gave to the king a negative upon the acts of the
legislature, with some feeble limitations. Every bill was to be presented
to the king, who might refuse his assent; but if the two following
legislatures should successively present the same bill in the same terms,
it was then to become a law. The constitutional negative, given to the
president of the United States, appears to be more wisely digested, than
any of the examples, which have been mentioned.
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 881.
 </b>
 The reasons, why the president should possess a
qualified negative,
if they are not quite obvious, are, at least, when fairly expounded,
entirely satisfactory. In the first place, there is a natural tendency in
the legislative department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the
powers of the other departments of government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
 A mere parchment
delineation of the boundaries of each is wholly insufficient for the
protection of the weaker branch, as the executive unquestionably is; and
hence there arises a constitutional necessity of arming it with powers for
its own defence. If the executive did not possess this qualified negative,
he would gradually be stripped of all his authority, and become, what it is
well known the governors of some states are, a mere pageant and shadow of
magistracy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">
   24
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 882.
 </b>
 In the next place, the power is important, as an additional
security against the enactment of rash, immature, and improper laws. It
establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body, calculated to
preserve the community against the effects of faction, precipitancy,
unconstitutional legislation, and temporary excitements, as well as
political hostility.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 It may, indeed, be said, that a single man, even
though he be president, cannot be presumed to possess more wisdom, or
virtue, or experience, than what belongs to a number of men. But this
furnishes no answer to the reasoning. The question is not, how much wisdom,
or virtue, or experience, is possessed by either branch of the government,
(though the executive magistrate may well be presumed to be eminently
distinguished in all these respects, and therefore the choice of the
people;) but whether the legislature may not be misled by a love of power,
a spirit of faction, a political impulse, or a persuasive influence, local
or sectional, which, at the same time, may not, from the difference in the
election and duties of the executive, reach him at all, or not reach him in
the same degree. He will always have a primary inducement to defend his own
powers; the legislature may well be presumed to have no desire to favour
them. He will have an opportunity soberly to examine the acts and
resolutions passed by the legislature, not having partaken of the feelings
or combinations, which have procured their passage, and thus correct, what
shall sometimes be wrong from haste and inadvertence, as well as design.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">
   26
  </a>
 </sup>
 His view of them, if not more wise, or more elevated, will, at least, be
</p>
<p>
 independent, and under an entirely different responsibility to the nation,
from what belongs to them. He is the representative of the whole nation in
the aggregate; they are the representatives only of distinct parts; and
sometimes of little more than sectional or local interests.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 883.
 </b>
 Nor is there any solid objection to this qualified
power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#27">
   27
  </a>
 </sup>
 If it
should be objected, that it may sometimes prevent the passage of good laws,
as well as of bad laws, the objection is entitled to but little weight. In
the first place, it can never be effectually exercised, if two thirds of
both houses are in favour of the law; and if they are not, it is not so
easily demonstrable, that the law is either wise or salutary. The
presumption would rather be the other way; or, at least, that the utility
of it was not unquestionable, or it would receive the requisite support. In
the next place, the great evil of all free governments is a tendency to
over legislation, and the mischief of inconstancy and mutability in the
laws forms a great blemish in the character and genius of all free
governments.
 <sup>
  <a href="#28">
   28
  </a>
 </sup>
 The injury, which may possibly arise from the postponement
of a salutary law, is far less, than from the passage of a mischievous one,
or from a redundant and vacillating legislation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#29">
   29
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the next place,
there is no practical danger, that this power would be much, if any, abused
by the president. The superior weight and influence of the legislative body
in a free government, and the hazard to the weight and influence of the
executive in a trial of strength, afford a satisfactory security, that the
power will generally be employed with great caution; and that there will be
more often room for a charge of
</p>
<p>
 timidity, than of rashness in its exercise.
 <sup>
  <a href="#30">
   30
  </a>
 </sup>
 It has been already seen,
that the British king, with all his sovereign attributes, has rarely
interposed this high prerogative, and that more than a century has elapsed
since its actual application. If from the offensive nature of the power a
royal hereditary executive thus indulges serious scruples in its actual
exercise, surely a republican president, chosen for four years, may be
presumed to be still more unwilling to exert it.
 <sup>
  <a href="#31">
   31
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 884.
 </b>
 The truth is, as has been already hinted, that the real
danger is,
that the executive will use the power too rarely. He will do it only on
extraordinary occasions, when a just regard to the public safety, or public
interests, or a constitutional obligation, or a necessity of maintaining
the appropriate rights and prerogatives of his office compels him to the
step;
 <sup>
  <a href="#32">
   32
  </a>
 </sup>
 and then it will be a solemn appeal to the people themselves from
their own representatives. Even within these narrow limits the power is
highly valuable; and it will silently operate as a preventive check, by
discouraging attempts to overawe, or to control the executive. Indeed, one
of the greatest benefits of such a power is, that its influence is felt,
not so much in its actual exercise, as in its silent and secret energy as a
preventive. It checks the intention to usurp, before it has ripened into an
act.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 885.
 </b>
 It has this additional recommendation, as a qualified
negative,
that it does not, like an absolute negative, present a categorical and
harsh resistance to the legislative will, which is so apt to engender
strife, and nourish hostility. It assumes the character of a mere appeal to
the legislature itself, and asks a revision
</p>
<p>
 of its own judgment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#33">
   33
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is in the nature, then, merely of a rehearing,
or a reconsideration, and involves nothing to provoke resentment, or rouse
pride. A president, who might hesitate to defeat a law by an absolute veto,
might feel little scruple to return it for reconsideration upon reasons and
arguments suggested on the return. If these were satisfactory to the
legislature, he would have the cheering support of a respectable portion of
the body in justification of his conduct. If, on the other hand, they
should not be satisfactory, the concurrence of two thirds would secure the
ultimate passage of the law, without exposing him to undue censure or
reproach. Even in such cases his opposition would not be without some
benefit. His observations would be calculated to excite public attention
and discussion, to lay bare the grounds, and policy, and constitutionality
of measures;
 <sup>
  <a href="#34">
   34
  </a>
 </sup>
 and to create a continued watchfulness, as to the practical
effects of the laws thus passed, so as that it might be ascertained by
experience, whether his sagacity and judgment were safer, than that of the
legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#35">
   35
  </a>
 </sup>
 Nothing but a gross abuse of the power upon frivolous, or
party pretences, to secure a petty triumph, or to defeat a wholesome
restraint, would bring it into contempt, or odium; and then, it would soon
be followed by that remedial justice from the people, in the exercise of
the right of election, which, first or last, will be found to follow with
reproof, or cheer with applause, the acts of their rulers, when passion and
prejudice have removed the temporary bandages, which have blinded their
judgment. Looking back upon the history of the government for the last
forty years, it will be
</p>
<p>
 found, that the president's negative has been rarely exerted; and whenever
it has been, no instance (it is believed) has occurred, in which the act
has been concurred in by two thirds of both houses. If the public opinion
has not, in all cases, sustained this exercise of the veto, it may be
affirmed, that it has rarely been found that the disapprobation has been
violent, or unqualified.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 886.
 </b>
 The proposition to unite the Supreme Court with the
executive in
the revision and qualified rejection of laws, failed, as has been seen, in
the convention.
 <sup>
  <a href="#36">
   36
  </a>
 </sup>
 Two reasons seem to have led to this result, and probably
were felt by the people also, as of decisive weight. The one was, that the
judges, who, are the interpreters of the law, might receive an improper
bias from having given a previous opinion in their revisory capacity. The
other was, that the judges, by being often associated with the executive,
might be induced to embark too far in the political views of that
magistrate; and thus a dangerous combination might, by degress, be cemented
between the executive and judiciary departments. It is impossible to keep
the judges too distinct from any other avocation, than that of expounding
the laws; and it is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be
either corrupted, or influenced by the executive.
 <sup>
  <a href="#37">
   37
  </a>
 </sup>
 To these may be added
another, which may almost be deemed a corollary from them, that it would
have a tendency to take from the judges that public confidence in their
impartiality, independence, and integrity, which seem indispensable to the
due administration of public justice. Whatever has a tendency to create
suspicion, or provoke jealousy, is mischievous to the judicial department.
</p>
<p>
 Judges should not only be pure, but be believed to be so. The moral
influence of their judgments is weakened, if not destroyed, whenever there
is a general, even though it be an unfounded distrust, that they are guided
by other motives in the discharge of their duties than the law and the
testimony. A free people have no security for their liberties, when an
appeal to the judicial department becomes either illusory, or
questionable.
 <sup>
  <a href="#38">
   38
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 887.
 </b>
 The other point of inquiry is, as to the extent of the
legislative
check upon the negative of the executive. It has been seen, that it was
originally proposed, that a concurrence of two thirds of each house should
be required; that this was subsequently altered to three fourths; and was
finally brought back again to the original number.
 <sup>
  <a href="#39">
   39
  </a>
 </sup>
 One reason against the
three fourths seems to have been, that it would afford little security for
any effectual exercise of the power. The larger the number required to
overrule the executive negative, the more easy it would be for him to exert
a silent and secret influence to detach the requisite number in order to
carry his object. Another reason was, that even, supposing no such
influence to be exerted, still, in a great variety of cases of a political
nature, and especially such, as touched local or sectional interests, the
pride or the power of states, it would be easy to defeat the most salutary
measures, if a combination of a few states
</p>
<p>
 could produce such a result. And the executive himself might, from his
local attachments or sectional feelings, partake of this common bias. In
addition to this, the departure from the general rule, of the right of a
majority to govern, ought not to be allowed but upon the most urgent
occasions; and an expression of opinion by two thirds of both houses in
favour of a measure certainly afforded all the just securities, which any
wise, or prudent people ought to demand in the ordinary course of
legislation; for all laws thus passed night, at any time, be repealed at
the mere will of the majority. It was also no small recommendation of the
lesser number, that it offered fewer inducements to improper combinations,
either of the great states, or the small states, to accomplish particular
objects. There could be but one of two rules adopted in all governments,
either, that the majority should govern, or the minority should govern. The
president might he chosen by a bare majority of electoral votes, and this
majority might be by the combination of a few large states, and by a
minority of the whole people. Under such circumstances, if a vote of three
fourths were required to pass a law, the voice of two thirds of the states
and two thirds of the people might be permanently disregarded during a
whole administration. The case put may seem strong; but it is not stronger,
than the supposition, that two thirds of both houses would be found ready
to betray the solid interests of their constituents by the passage of
injurious or unconstitutional laws. The provision, therefore, as it stands,
affords all reasonable security; and pressed farther, it would endanger the
very objects, for which it is introduced into the constitution.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 888.
 </b>
 But the president might effectually defeat the
wholesome restraint,
thus intended, upon his qualified
</p>
<p>
 negative, if he might silently decline to act after a bill was presented to
him for approval or rejection. The constitution, therefore, has wisely
provided, that "if any bill shall not be returned by the president within
ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, it
shall be a law, in like manner, as if he had signed it."
 <sup>
  <a href="#40">
   40
  </a>
 </sup>
 But if this
clause stood alone, congress might, in like manner, defeat the due exercise
of his qualified negative by a termination of the session, which would
render it impossible for the president to return the bill. It is therefore
added, "unless the congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return, in
which case it shall not be a law."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 889.
 </b>
 The remaining clause merely applies to orders,
resolutions, and
votes, to which the concurrence of both houses may be necessary; and as to
these, with a single exception, the same rule is applied, as is by the
preceding clause applied to bills. If this provision had not been made,
congress, by adopting the form of an order or resolution, instead of a
bill, might hare effectually defeated the president's qualified negative in
all the most important portions of legislation.

 <b>
  § 890.
 </b>
 It has been remarked by De Lolme, that in most of the
ancient free
states, the share of the people in the business of legislation was to
approve or reject the propositions, which were made to them, and to give
the final sanction to the laws. The functions of those persons, or in
general, those bodies, who were entrusted with the executive power, was to
prepare and frame
</p>
<p>
 the laws, and then to propose them to the people. In a word, they possessed
that branch of the legislative power, which may be called the initiative,
that is, the prerogative of putting that power into action. In the first
times of the Roman republic, this initiative power was constantly exercised
by the Roman senate. Laws were made populi jussu, ex authoritate senati;
and, even in elections, the candidates were subject to the previous
approbation of the senate. In modern times, in the republics of Venice,
Berne, and Geneva, the same power is, in fact, exercised by a select
assembly, before it can be acted upon by the larger assembly of the
citizens, or their representatives.
 <sup>
  <a href="#42">
   42
  </a>
 </sup>
 He has added, that this power is
very useful, and perhaps even necessary, in states of a republican form,
for giving a permanence to the laws, as well as for preventing political
disorders and struggles for power. At the same time, he is compelled to
admit, that this expedient is attended with inconveniences of little less
magnitude, than the evils it is meant to remedy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#43">
   43
  </a>
 </sup>
 The inconveniences are
certainly great, but there are evils of a deeper character belonging to
such a system. The natural, nay, necessary tendency of it is, ultimately to
concentrate all power in the initiative body, and to leave to the approving
body but the shadow of authority. It is in fact, though not in form, an
oligarchy. And, so far from its being useful in a republic, it is the
surest means of sapping all its best institutions, and overthrowing the
public liberties, by corrupting the very fountains of legislation. De Lolme
praises it as a peculiar excellence of the British monarchy. America, no
less, vindicates it, as a fundamental principle in all her republican
constitutions.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 891.
 </b>
 We have thus passed through all the clauses of the constitution
respecting the structure and organization of the legislative department,
and the rights, powers, and privileges of the component branches severally,
as well as in the aggregate. The natural order of the constitution next
leads us to the consideration of the POWERS, which are vested, by the
constitution, in the legislative department. Before, however, entering upon
this large and important inquiry, it may be useful to state, in a summary
manner, the ordinary course of proceedings at each new session of congress,
and the mode, in which laws are usually passed, according to the settled
usages in congress, under the rules and orders of the two houses. In
substance, it does not differ from the manner of conducting the like
business in the British parliament.

 <b>
  § 892.
 </b>
 On the day appointed for the assembling of a new
congress, the
members of each house meet in their separate apartments. The house of
representatives then proceed to the choice of a speaker and clerk, and any
one member is authorized then to administer the oath of office to the
speaker, who then administers the like oath to the other members, and to
the clerk. The like oath is administered by any member of the senate, to
the president of the senate, who then administers a like oath to all the
members, and the secretary of the senate; and this proceeding, is had,
when, and as often as a new president of the senate, or member, or
secretary, is chosen.
 <sup>
  <a href="#45">
   45
  </a>
 </sup>
 As soon as these preliminaries are gone through,
and a quorum of each house is present, notice is given thereof to the
president, who signifies
</p>
<p>
 his intention to address them. This was formerly done by way of speech; but
is now done by a written message, transmitted to each house, containing a
general exposition of the affairs of the nation, and a recommendation of
such measures, as the president may deem fit for the consideration of
congress. When the habit was for the president to make a speech, it was in
the presence of both houses, and a written answer was prepared by each
house, which, when accepted, was presented by a committee. At present, no
answer whatsoever is given to the contents of the message. And this change
of proceeding has been thought, by many statesmen, to be a change for the
worse, since the answer of each house enabled each party in the legislature
to express its own views, as to the matters in the speech, and to propose,
by way of amendment to the answer, whatever was deemed more correct and
more expressive of public sentiment, than was contained in either. The
consequence was, that the whole policy and conduct of the administration
came under solemn review; and it was animadverted on, or defended, with
equal zeal and independence, according to the different views of the
speakers in the debate; and the final vote showed the exact state of public
opinion on all leading measures. By the present practice of messages, this
facile and concentrated opportunity of attack or defence is completely
taken away; and the attack or defence of the administration is perpetually
renewed at distant intervals, as an incidental topic in all other
discussions, to which it often bears very slight, and perhaps no relation.
The result is, that a great deal of time is lost in collateral debates, and
that the administration is driven to defend itself, in detail, on every
leading motion, or measure of the session.

 <b>
  § 893.
 </b>
 A bill may be introduced by motion of a member, and leave
of the
house; or it may be introduced by order of the house, on the report of a
committee; or it may be reported by a committee. In cases of a general
nature, one day's notice is given of a motion to bring in a bill. The bill,
however introduced, is drawn out on paper, with a multitude of blanks or
void spaces, where any thing occurs, that is dubious, or necessary to be
settled by the house; such, especially, as dates of times, sums of money,
amount of penalties, and limitations of numbers. It is then read a first
time for information; and if any opposition is made to it, the question is
then put, whether it shall be rejected. If no opposition is made, or if the
question to reject is negatived, the bill goes to a second reading without
a question, and it is accordingly read a second time at some convenient
distance of time. Every bill must receive three readings in the house
previous to its passage; and these readings are on different days, unless
upon a special order of the house to the contrary. Upon the second reading
of a bill, the speaker states it, as ready for commitment, or engrossment.
If committed, it is committed either to a select, or a standing committee,
or to a committee of the whole house. If to the latter, the house determine
on what day. If the bill is ordered to be engrossed, (that is, copied out
in a fair, large, round hand,) the house then appoint the day, when it
shall be read the third time. Most of the important bills are committed to
a committee of the whole house; and every motion or proposition for a tax
or charge upon the people, and for a variation in the sum
</p>
<p>
 or quantum of a tax or duty, and for an appropriation of money, is required
first to be discussed in a committee of the whole house. The great object
of referring any matter to a committee of the whole house is, to allow a
greater freedom of discussion, and more times of speaking, than is
generally allowed by the rules of the house. It seems, too, that the yeas
and nays are not required to be taken upon votes in committee, as they may
be in votes in the house.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 894.
 </b>
 On going into a committee of the whole house, the
speaker leaves
the chair, and a chairman is appointed by the speaker to preside in
committee. Amendments and other proceedings are had in committee much in
the same way, as occur in the regular course of the business of the house.
Select and standing committees regulate their own times and modes of
proceeding according to their own discretion and pleasure, unless otherwise
ordered by the house. They make their reports in the same way from lime to
time to the house, and secure the directions of the latter. When a bill is
committed to a committee, it is read in sections; paragraph after paragraph
is debated; blanks are filled up; and alterations and amendments, both in
form and substance, are proposed, and often made.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 895.
 </b>
 After the committee have gone through with the whole bill, they
report it, with all the alterations and amendments made in it, to the
house. It is then, or at some suitable time afterwards, considered by the
latter, and the question separately put upon every alteration, amendment,
and clause. After commitment and report to the house, and at any time
before its passage, any bill may be recommitted at the pleasure of the
house. When a bill, either upon a report of a committee, or after full
discussion and amendment in the house,
</p>
<p>
 stands for the next stage of its progress, the question then is, whether it
shall be engrossed and read a third time. And this is the proper time
commonly chosen by those, who are fundamentally opposed to it, to make
their attack upon it, it now being as perfect, as its friends can shape it,
and as little exceptionable, as its enemies have been able to make it.
Attempts are, indeed, sometimes made at previous stages to defeat it, but
they are usually disjointed efforts; because many persons, who do not
expect to be in favour of the bill ultimately, are willing to let it go on
to its most perfect state, to take time to examine it for themselves, and
to hear what can be said in its favour.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 896.
 </b>
 The two last stages of the bill, viz. on the questions,
whether it
shall have a third reading, and whether it shall pass, are the strong
points of resistance, and defence. The first is usually the most
interesting contest, because the subject is more new and engaging, and the
trial of strength has not been made; so that the struggle for victory is
yet wholly doubtful, and the ardour of debate is proportionally warm and
earnest. If the bill is ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, it is,
when engrossed, put upon its final passage. Amendments are sometimes made
to it at this stage, though reluctantly; and any new clause, thus added, is
called a rider. If the vote is, that the bill shall pass, the title is then
settled, though a title is always reported with the bill; and that being
agreed to, the day of its passage is noted at the foot of it by the clerk.
It is then signed by the speaker, and transmitted to the other house for
concurrence therein.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 897.
 </b>
 The bill, when thus transmitted to the other house,
goes through
similar forms. It is either rejected, committed, or concurred in, with, or
without amend-
</p>
<p>
 ments. If a bill is amended by the house, to which it transmitted, it is
then returned to the other house, in which it originated, for their assent
to the amendment. If the amendment is agreed to, the fact is made known to
the other house. If not agreed to, the disagreement is in like manner
notified. And the like course is adopted, where the amendment is agreed to
with an amendment. In either of these cases, the house proposing the
amendment may recede from it; or may adopt it with the amendment proposed
by the other house. If neither is done, the house then vote to insist on
the amendment, or to adhere to it. A vote to insist keeps the question
still open. But a vote to adhere requires the other house either to insist,
or to recede; for if, on their part, there is a vote to adhere, the bill
usually falls without farther effort. But, upon a disagreement between the
two houses, a conference by a committee of each is usually asked; and in
this manner the matters in controversy are generally adjusted by adopting
the course recommended by the committees, or one of them. When a bill has
passed both houses, the house last acting on it makes known its passage to
the other, and it is delivered to the joint committee of enrolment, who
see, that it is truly enrolled in parchment, and being signed by the
speaker of the house, and the president of the senate, it is then sent to
the president for his signature. If he approves it, he signs it; and it is
then deposited among the rolls in the office of the department of state. If
he disapproves of it, he returns it to the house, in which it originated,
with his objections. Here they are entered at large on the journal, and
afterwards the house proceed to a consideration of them.

  § 898.
 </b>
 This review of the forms and modes of proceeding in the
passing of
laws cannot fail to impress upon every mind the cautious steps, by which
legislation is guarded, and the solicitude to conduct business without
precipitancy, rashness, or irregularity. Frequent opportunities are
afforded to each house to review their own proceedings; to amend their own
errors; to correct their own inadvertencies; to recover from the results of
any passionate excitement; and to reconsider the votes, to which persuasive
eloquence, or party spirit has occasionally misled their judgments. Under
such circumstances, if legislation be unwise, or loose, or inaccurate, it
belongs to the infirmity of human nature in general, or to that personal
carelessness and indifference, which is sometimes the foible of genius, as
well as the accompaniment of ignorance and prejudice.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 899.
 </b>
 The structure and organization of the several branches,
composing
the legislature, have also (unless my judgment has misled me) been shown by
the past review to be admirably adapted to preserve a wholesome and upright
exercise of their powers. All the checks, which human ingenuity has been
able to devise, (at least, all which, with reference to our habits,
institutions, and local interests, seemed practicable, or desirable,) to
give perfect operation to the machinery of government; to adjust all its
movements; to prevent its eccentricities; and to balance its forces;--all
these have been introduced, with singular skill, ingenuity, and wisdom,
into the structure of the constitution.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 900.
 </b>
 Yet, after all, the fabric may fall; for the
</p>
<p>
 work of man is perishable, and must for ever have inherent elements of
decay. Nay, it must perish, if there be not that vital spirit in the
people, which alone can nourish, sustain, and direct all its movements. It
is in vain, that statesmen shall form plans of government, in which the
beauty and harmony of a republic shall be embodied in visible order, shall
be built up on solid substructions, and adorned by every useful ornament,
if the inhabitants suffer the silent power of time to dilapidate its walls,
or crumble its massy supporters into dust; if the assaults from without are
never resisted, and the rottenness and mining from within are never guarded
against. Who can preserve the rights and liberties of the people, when they
shall be abandoned by themselves? Who shall keep watch in the temple, when
the watchmen sleep at their posts? Who shall call upon the people to redeem
their possessions, and revive the republic, when their own hands have
deliberately and corruptly surrendered them to the oppressor, and have
built the prisons, or dug the graves of their own friends? Aristotle, in
ancient times, upon a large survey of the republics of former days, and of
the facile manner, in which they had been made the instruments of their own
destruction, felt himself compelled to the melancholy reflection, which has
been painfully repeated by one of the greatest statesmen of modern times,
that a democracy has many striking points of resemblance with a tyranny.
"The ethical character," says he, "is the same; both exercise despotism
over the better class of citizens; and the decrees are in the one, what
ordinances and arrets are in the other. The demagogue, too, and the court
favourite are not unfrequently the same identical men, and always bear a
close analogy. And these have the principal power, each in their re-
</p>
<p>
 spective governments, favourites with the absolute monarch, and demagogues
with a people, such as I have described."

  § 901.
 </b>
 This dark picture, it is to be hoped, will never be
applicable to
the republic of America And yet it affords a warning, which, like all the
lessons of past experience, we are not permitted to disregard. America,
free, happy, and enlightened, as she is, must rest the preservation of her
rights and liberties upon the virtue, independence, justice, and sagacity
of the people. If either fail, the republic is gone. Its shadow may remain
with all the pomp, and circumstance, and trickery of government, but its
vital power will have departed. In America, the demagogue may arise, as
well as elsewhere. He is the natural, though spurious growth of republics;
and like the courtier he may, by his blandishments, delude the ears, and
blind the eyes of the people to their own destruction. If ever the day
shall arrive, in which the best talents and the best virtues shall be
driven from office by intrigue or corruption, by the ostracism of the
press, or the still more unrelenting persecution of party, legislation will
cease to be national. It will be wise by accident, and bad by system.
