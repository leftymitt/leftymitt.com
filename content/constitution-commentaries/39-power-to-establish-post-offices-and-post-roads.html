§ 1119.
</b>
The next power of confess is, "to
establish post-offices and post-roads." The nature and extent of this
power, both theoretically and practically, are of great importance, and have
given rise to much ardent controversy. It deserves, therefore, a deliberate
examination. It was passed over by the Federalist with a single remark, as a
power not likely to be disputed in its exercise, or to be deemed dangerous by
its scope. The "power," says the Federalist, "of establishing
post-roads must, in every view, be a harmless power; and may, perhaps, by
judicious management, become productive of great public conveniency. Nothing,
which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the states, can be deemed
unworthy of the public care."

One
cannot but feel, at the present time, an inclination to smile at the guarded
caution of these expressions, and the hesitating avowal of the importance of the
power. It affords, perhaps, one of the most striking proofs, how much the growth
and prosperity of the country have outstripped the most sanguine anticipations
of our most enlightened patriots.

§ 1120.

The post-office establishment has
already become one of the most beneficent, and useful establishments under the
national government.
<a href="#002">

<sup>

</a>
It circulates
intelligence of a commercial, political, intellectual, and private nature, with
incredible speed and regularity. It thus administers, in a very high degree, to
the comfort, the interests, and the necessities of persons, in every rank and
station of life. It brings the most distant places and persons, as it were, in
contact with each other; and thus softens the anxieties, increases the
enjoyments, and cheers the solitude of millions of hearts. It imparts a new
influence and impulse to private intercourse; and, by a wider diffusion of
knowledge, enables political rights and duties to be performed with more
uniformity and sound judgment. It is not less effective, as an instrument of the
government in its own operations. In peace, it enables it without ostentation or
expense to send its orders, and direct its measures for the public good, and
transfer its funds, and apply its powers, with a facility and promptitude which,
compared with the tardy operations, and imbecile expedients of former times,
seem like the wonders of magic. In war it is, if possible, still more important
and useful, communicating intelligence vital to the movements of armies and
navies, and the operations and duties of warfare, with a rapidity, which, if it
does not always ensure victory, at least, in many instances, guards against
defeat and ruin. Thus, its influences have become, in a public, as well as
private view, of incalculable value to the permanent interests of the Union. It
is obvious at a moment's glance at the subject, that the establishment in the
hands of the states would have been wholly inadequate to these objects; and the
impracticability of a uniformity of system would have introduced infinite delays
and inconveniences; and burthened the mails with an endless variety of vexatious
taxations, and regulations. No one, accustomed to the retardations of the post
in passing through independent states on the continent of Europe, can fail to
appreciate the benefits of a power, which pervades the Union. The national
government is that alone, which can safely or effectually execute it, with equal
promptitude and cheapness, certainty and uniformity. Already the post-office
establishment realizes a revenue exceeding two millions of dollars, from which
it defrays all its own expenses, and transmits mails in various directions over
more than one hundred and twenty thousand miles. It transmits intelligence in
one day to distant places, which, when the constitution was first put into
operation, was scarcely transmitted through the same distance in the course of a
week.

</a>
The rapidity of its movements
has been in a general view doubled within the last twenty years. There are now
more than eight thousand five hundred post-offices in the United States; and at
every session of the legislature new routes are constantly provided for, and new
post-offices established. It may, therefore, well be deemed a most beneficent
power, whose operations can scarcely he applied, except for good, and accomplish
in an eminent degree some of the high purposes set forth in the preamble of the
constitution, forming a more perfect union, providing for the common defence,
and promoting the general welfare.

§ 1121.
</b>
Under the confederation, (art. 9,)
congress was invested with the sole and exclusive power of "establishing
and regulating post-offices
<i>
from one state to another
</i>
throughout the
United States, and exacting such postage on the papers passing through the same,
as may be requisite to defray the expenses of the said office."
<a href="#004">
<b>
<sup>
4
</sup>
</b>
</a>
How little was accomplished under it
will be at once apparent from the fact, that there were but seventy-five
post-offices established in all the United States in the year 1789; that the
whole amount of postage in 1790 was only $37,935; and the number of miles
travelled by the mails only 1875.
<a href="#005">
<b>
<sup>
5
</sup>
</b>
</a>
This
may be in part attributable to the state of the country, and the depression of
all the commercial and other interests of the country. But the power itself was
so crippled by the confederation, that it could accomplish little. The national
government did not possess any power, except to establish post-offices from
state to state, (leaving perhaps, though not intended, the whole interior
post-offices in every state to its own regulation,) and the postage, that could
be taken, was not allowed to be beyond the actual expenses; thus shutting up the
avenue to all improvements. In short, like every other power under the
confederation, it perished from a jealousy, which required it to live, and yet
refused it appropriate nourishment and sustenance.

§ 1122.
</b>
In the first draft of the
constitution, the clause stood thus, "Congress shall have power to
establish post-offices." It was subsequently amended by adding the words "and
post-roads," by the vote of six states against five; and then, as amended,
it passed without opposition.
<a href="#007">
<b>
<sup>
7
</sup>
</b>
</a>
It is
observable, that the confederation gave only the power to establish and regulate
<i>
post-offices
</i>
; and therefore the amendment introduced a new and
substantive power, unknown before in the national government.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1123">
</a>
<b>
§ 1123.
</b>
Upon the construction of this
clause of the constitution, two opposite opinions have been expressed. One
maintains, that the power to establish post-offices and post-roads can intend no
more, than the power to direct, where post-offices shall be kept, and on what
roads the mails shall be carried.
<a href="#008">
<b>
<sup>
8
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Or,
as it has been on other occasions expressed, the power to establish post-roads
is a power to designate, or point out, what roads shall be mail-roads, and the
right of passage or way along them, when so designated.
<a href="#009">
<b>
<sup>
9
</sup>
</b>
</a>
The other maintains, that although these modes of exercising the power are
perfectly constitutional; yet they are not the whole of the power, and do not
exhaust it. On the contrary, the power comprehends the right to make, or
construct any roads, which congress may deem proper for the conveyance of the
mail, and to keep them in due repair for such purpose.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1124">
</a>
<b>
§ 1124.
</b>
The grounds of the former opinion
seem to be as follows. The power given under the confederation never practically
received any other construction. Congress never undertook to make any roads, but
merely designated those existing roads, on which the mail should pass. At the
adoption of the constitution there is not the slightest evidence, that a
different arrangement, as to the limits of the power, was contemplated. On the
contrary, it was treated by the Federalist, as a harmless power, and not
requiring any comment.
<a href="#010">
<b>
<sup>
10
</sup>
</b>
</a>
The practice
of the government, since the adoption of the constitution, has conformed to this
view. The first act passed by congress, in 1799, is entitled "an act to
establish post-offices and post-roads." The first section of this act
established many post-offices as well as post-roads. It was continued, amended,
and finally repealed, by a series of acts from 1792 to 1810; all of which acts
have the same title, and the same provisions declaring certain roads to be
post-roads. From all of which it is manifest, that the legislature supposed,
that they had established post-roads in the sense of the constitution, when they
declared certain roads, then in existence, to be post-roads, and designated the
routes, along which the mails were to pass. As a farther proof upon this
subject, the statute book contains many acts passed at various times, during a
period of more than twenty years, discontinuing certain post-roads.
<a href="#011">
<b>
<sup>
11
</sup>
</b>
</a>
A strong argument is also derivable
from the practice of continental Europe, which must be presumed to have been
known to the framers of the constitution. Different nations in Europe have
established posts, and for mutual convenience have stipulated a free passage for
the posts arriving on their frontiers through their territories. It is probable,
that the constitution intended nothing more by this provision, than to enable
congress to do by law, without consulting the states, what in Europe can be done
only by treaty or compact. It was thought necessary to insert an express
provision in the constitution, enabling the government to exercise jurisdiction
over ten miles square for a seat of government, and of such places, as should be
ceded by the states for forts, arsenals, and other similar purposes. It is
incredible, that such solicitude should have been expressed for such
inconsiderable spots, and yet, that at the same time, the constitution intended
to convey by implication the power to construct roads throughout the whole
country, with the consequent right to use the timber and soil, and to exercise
jurisdiction over them. It may be said, that, unless congress have the power,
the mail-roads might be obstructed, or discontinued at the will of the state
authorities. But that consequence does not follow; for when a road is declared
by law to be a mail-road, the United States have a right of way over it; and,
until the law is repealed, such an interest in the use of it, as that the state
authorities could not obstruct it.
<a href="#012">
<b>
<sup>
12
</sup>
</b>
</a>
The terms of the constitution are perfectly satisfied by this limited
construction, and the power of congress to make whatever roads they may please,
in any state, would be a most serious inroad upon the rights and jurisdiction of
the states. It never could have been contemplated.
<a href="#013">

</b>
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a id="1125">
</a>
<b>
§ 1125.
</b>
The grounds, upon which the other
opinion is maintained, are as follows: This is not a question of implied power;
but of express power. We are not now looking to what are properly incidents, or
means to carry into effect given powers; but are to construe the terms of an
express power. The words of the constitution are, "Congress shall have
power to "establish post-offices and post-roads." What is the true
meaning of these words? There is no such known sense of the word "establish,"
as to "direct," "designate," or "point out." And
if there were, it does not follow, that a special or peculiar sense is to be
given to the words, not conformable to their general meaning, unless that sense
be required by the context, or, at least, better harmonizes with the subject
matter, and objects of the power, than any other sense. That cannot be pretended
in the present case. The received general meanings, if not the only meanings of
the word "establish," are, to settle firmly, to confirm, to fix, to
form or modify, to found, to build firmly, to erect permanently.
<a href="#014">
<b>
<sup>
14
</sup>
</b>
</a>
And it is no small objection to any construction, that it requires the word to
be deflected from its received and usual meaning; and gives it a meaning unknown
to, and unacknowledged by lexicographers. Especially is it objectionable and
inadmissible, where the received and common meaning harmonizes with the subject
matter; and if the very end were required, no more exact expression could
ordinarily be used. In legislative acts, in state papers, and in the
constitution itself, the word is found with the same general sense now insisted
on; that is, in the sense of, to create, to form, to make, to construct, to
settle, to build up with a view to permanence. Thus, our treaties speak of
establishing regulations of trade. Our laws speak of
<i>
establishing
</i>
navy-hospitals, where land is to be purchased, work done, and buildings erected;
of
<i>
establishing
</i>
trading-houses with the Indians, where houses are to be
erected and other things done. The word is constantly used in a like sense in
the articles of confederation. The authority is therein given to congress of
<i>
establishing
</i>
rules in cases of captures; of
<i>
establishing
</i>
courts
of appeal in cases of capture; and, what is directly in point, of
<i>
establishing
</i>
and
<i>
regulating post-offices
</i>
. Now, if the meaning of the word here was simply
to point out, or designate post-offices, there would have been an end of all
further authority, except of regulating the post-offices, so designated and
pointed out. Under such circumstances, how could it have been possible under
that instrument (which declares, that every power not
<i>
expressly
</i>
delegated shall be retained by the states) to find any authority to carry the
mail, or to make contracts for this purpose? Much more to prohibit any other
persons under penalties from conveying letters, despatches, or other packets
from one place to another of the United States? The very first act of the
continental congress on this subject was, "for
<i>
establishing
</i>
a post,"
(not a post office;) and it directed, "that a line of posts be appointed
under the direction of the postmaster general, from Falmouth, in New-England; to
Savannah, in Georgia, with as many cross-posts, as he shall think fit;" and
it directs the necessary expenses of the "
<i>
establishment
</i>
"
beyond the revenue to be paid out by the United Colonies.
<a href="#015">
<b>
<sup>
15
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Under this, and other supplementary acts, the establishment continued until
October, 1782, when, under the articles of confederation, the establishment was
re-organized, and, instead of a mere appointment and designation of
post-offices, provision was made, "that a continued communication of posts
throughout the United States shall be
<i>
established
</i>
and maintained," &amp;c.;
and many other regulations were made wholly incompatible with the narrow
construction of the words now contended for.

<p>
<a id="1126">

<b>
§ 1126.
</b>
The constitution itself also
uniformly uses the word "establish" in the general sense, and never in
this peculiar and narrow sense. It speaks in the preamble of one motive being, "to
<i>
establish
</i>
justice," and that the people do
<i>
ordain
</i>
and
<i>
establish
</i>
this constitution. It gives power to
<i>
establish
</i>
an uniform rule of
naturalization and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies. Does not this
authorize congress to make, create, form, and construct laws on these subjects?
It declares, that the judicial power shall be vested in one supreme court and in
such inferior courts, as congress may, from time to time,
<i>
ordain
</i>
and
<i>
establish
</i>
. Is not a power to
<i>
establish
</i>
courts a power to create, and make, and regulate them? It
declares, that the ratification of nine states shall be sufficient for the
<i>
establishment
</i>
of this constitution between the states so ratifying the
same.
<a href="#017">
<b>
<sup>
17
</sup>
</b>
</a>
And in one of the amendments,
it provides, that congress shall make no law respecting an
<i>
establishment
</i>
of religion. It is plain, that to construe the word in any of these cases, as
equivalent to
<i>
designate
</i>
, or
<i>
point out
</i>
, would be absolutely absurd. The clear import of the word is,
to create, and form, and fix in a settled manner. Referring it to the subject
matter, the sense, in no instance, can be mistaken. To establish courts is to
create, and form, and regulate them. To establish rules of naturalization is to
frame and confirm such rules. To establish laws on the subject of bankruptcies
is to frame, fix, and pass them. To establish the constitution is to make, and
fix, and erect it, as a permanent form of government. In the same manner, to
establish post-offices and post-roads is to frame and pass laws, to erect, make,
form, regulate, and preserve them. Whatever is necessary, whatever is
appropriate to this purpose, is within the power.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1127">
</a>
<b>
§ 1127.
</b>
Besides; upon this narrow
construction, what becomes of the power itself? If the power be to
<i>
point out
</i>
,
or
<i>
designate post-offices
</i>
, then it supposes, that there already exist
some offices, out of which a designation can be made. It supposes a power to
select among things of the same nature. Now, if an office does not already exist
at the place, how can it be designated, as a post-office? If you cannot create a
post-office, you can do no more, than mark out one already existing. In short,
these rules of strict construction might be pressed still farther; and, as the
power is only given to designate, not offices, but post-offices, the latter must
be already in existence; for otherwise the power must be read, to designate what
offices shall be used, as post-offices, or at what places post-offices shall be
recognised; either of which is a departure from the supposed literal
interpretation.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1128">
</a>
<b>
§ 1128.
</b>
In the next place, let us see, what
upon this narrow interpretation becomes of the power in another aspect. It is to
establish post-offices. Now, the argument supposes, that this does not authorize
the purchase or erection of a building for an office; but it does necessarily
suppose the authority to erect or create an office; to regulate the duties of
the officer; and to fix a place, (
<i>
officina
</i>
) where his business is to be
performed. It then unavoidably includes, not merely a power to designate, but a
power to create the thing intended, and to do all other acts to make the thing
effectual; that is, to create the whole system appropriate to a post-office
establishment. Now, this involves a plain departure from the very ground of the
argument. It is no longer a power to designate a thing, or mark out a route; but
it is a power to create, and fix every other thing necessary-and appropriate to
post-offices. The argument, therefore, resorts to implications in order to
escape from its own narrow interpretation; and the very power to designate
becomes a power to create offices and frame systems, and institute penalties,
and raise revenue, and make contracts. It becomes, in fact, the very thing,
which the other argument supposes to be the natural sense, viz. the power to
erect, and maintain a post-office establishment.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1129">
</a>
<b>
§ 1129.
</b>
Under any other interpretation, the
power itself would become a mere nullity. If resort be had to a very strict and
critical examination of the words, the power "to establish post-offices"
imports no more, than the power to create the offices intended; that done, the
power is exhausted; and the words are satisfied. The power to create the office
does not necessarily include the power to carry the mail, or regulate the
conveyance of letters, or employ carriers. The one may exist independently of
the other. A state might without absurdity possess the right to carry the mail,
while the United States might possess the right to designate the post-offices,
at which it should be opened, and provide the proper officers; or the converse
powers might belong to each. It would not be impracticable, though it would be
extremely inconvenient and embarrassing. Yet, no man ever imagined such a
construction to be justifiable. And why not? Plainly, because constitutions of
government are not instruments to be scrutinized, and weighed, upon metaphysical
or grammatical niceties. They do not turn upon ingenious subtleties; but are
adapted to the business and exigencies of human society; and the powers given
are understood in a large sense, in order to secure the public interests. Common
sense becomes the guide, and prevents men from dealing with mere logical
abstractions. Under the confederation, this very power to establish post-offices
was construed to include the other powers already named, and others far more
remote. It never entered into the heads of the wise men of those days, that they
possessed a power to create post-offices, without the power to create all the
other things necessary to make post-offices of some human use. They did not
dream of post-offices without posts, or mails, or routes, or carriers. It would
have been worse than a mockery. Under the confederation, with the strict
limitation of powers, which that instrument conferred, they put into operation a
large system for the appropriate purposes of a post-office establishment.
<a href="#018">
<b>
<sup>
18
</sup>
</b>
</a>
No man ever doubted, or denied the
constitutionality of this exercise of the power. It was largely construed to
meet the obvious intent, for which it was delegated. The words of the
constitution are more extensive, than those of the confederation. In the latter,
the words to establish "
<i>
post-roads
</i>
" are not to be found. These
words were certainly added for some purpose. And if any, for what other purpose,
than to enable congress to lay out and make roads?

§ 1130.
</b>
Under the constitution congress
has, without any questioning, given a liberal construction to the power to
establish post-offices and post-roads. It has been truly said, that in a strict
sense, "this power is executed by the single act of making the
establishment. But from this has been inferred the power and duty of carrying
the mail along the post-road from one post-office to another. And from this
implied power has been again inferred the right to punish those, who steal
letters from the post-office, or rob the mail. It may be said with some
plausibility, that the right to carry the mail, and to punish those, who rob it,
is not indispensably necessary to the establishment of a post-office and a
post-road. This right is indeed essential to the beneficial exercise of the
power; but not indispensably necessary to its existence."

§ 1131.
</b>
The whole practical course of the
government upon this subject, from its first organization down to the present
time, under every administration, has repudiated the strict and narrow
construction of the words above mentioned.
<a href="#021">
<b>
<sup>
21
</sup>
</b>
</a>
The power to establish post-offices and post-roads has never been understood to
include no more, than the power to point out and designate post-offices and
post-roads. Resort has been constantly had to the more expanded sense of the
word "establish;" and no other sense can include the objects, which
the post-office laws have constantly included. Nay, it is not only not true,
that these laws have stopped short of an exposition of the words sufficiently
broad to justify the making of roads; but they have included exercises of power
far more remote from the immediate objects. If the practice of the government
is, therefore, of any weight in giving a constitutional interpretation, it is in
favour of the liberal interpretation of the clause.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1132">
</a>
<b>
§ 1132.
</b>
The fact, if true, that congress
have not hitherto made any roads for the carrying of the mall, would not affect
the right, or touch the question. It is not doubted, that the power has been
properly carried into effect, by making certain state roads post-roads. When
congress found those roads suited to the purpose, there could be no
constitutional reason for refusing to establish them, as mail-routes. The
exercise of authority was clearly within the scope of the power. But the
argument would have it, that, because this exercise of the power, clearly within
its scope, has been hitherto restrained to making existing roads post-roads,
therefore congress cannot proceed constitutionally to make a post-road, where no
road now exists. This is clearly what lawyers call a
<i>
non sequitur
</i>
. It
might with just as much propriety be urged, that, because congress had not
hitherto used a particular means to execute any other given power, therefore it
could not now do it. If, for instance, congress had never provided a ship for
the navy, except by purchase, they could not now authorize ships to be built for
a navy, or
<i>
à converso
</i>
. If they had not laid a tax on certain
goods, it could not now be done. If they had never erected a custom-house, or
court-house, they could not now do it. Such a mode of reasoning would be deemed
by all persons wholly indefensible.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1133">
</a>
<b>
§ 1133.
</b>
But it is not admitted, that
congress have not exercised this very power with reference to this very object.
By the act of 21st of April, 1806, (ch. 41,) the president was authorized to
cause to be opened a road from the frontier of Georgia, on the route from Athens
to New-Orleans; and to cause to be opened a road or roads through the territory,
then lately ceded by the Indians to the United States, from the river
Mississippi to the Ohio, and to the former Indian boundary line, which was
established by the treaty of Greenville; and to cause to be opened a road from
Nashville, in the state of Tennessee, to Natchez, in the Mississippi territory.
The same remark applies to the act of 29th of March, 1806, (ch. 19,) "to
regulate the laying out and making a road from Cumberland, in the state of
Maryland, to the state of Ohio." Both of these acts were passed in the
administration of President Jefferson, who, it is well known, on other occasions
maintained a strict construction of the constitution.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1134">
</a>
<b>
§ 1134.
</b>
But passing by considerations of
this nature, why does not the power to establish post-offices and post-roads
include the power to make and construct them, when wanted, as well as the power
to establish a navy-hospital, or a custom-house, a power to make and construct
them? The latter is not doubted by any persons; why then is the former? In each
case, the sense of the ruling term "establish" would seem to be the
same; in each, the power may be carried into effect by means short of
constructing, or purchasing the things authorized. A temporary use of a suitable
site or buildings may possibly be obtained with, or without hire. Besides; why
may not congress purchase, or erect a post-office building, and buy the
necessary land, if it be in their judgment advisable? Can there be a just doubt,
that a power to establish post-offices includes this power, just as much, as a
power to establish custom-houses would to build the latter? Would it not be a
strange construction to say, that the abstract office might be created, but not
the officina, or place, where it could be exercised? There are many places
peculiarly fit for local post-offices, where no suitable building might be
found. And, if a power to construct post-office buildings exists, where is the
restraint upon constructing roads?
</p>
<p>
<a id="1135">
</a>
<b>
§ 1135.
</b>
It is said, that there is no
reason, why congress should be invested with such a power, seeing that the state
roads may, and will furnish convenient routes for the mail. When the state-roads
do furnish such routes, there can certainly be no sound policy in congress
making other routes. But there is a great difference between the policy of
exercising a power, and the right of exercising it. But, suppose the state-roads
do not furnish (as in point of fact they did not at the time of the adoption of
the constitution, and as hereafter, for many exigencies of the government in
times of war and otherwise, they may not) suitable routes for the mails, what is
then to be done? Is the power of the general government to be paralyzed? Suppose
a mail-road is out of repair and founderous, cannot congress authorize the
repair of it? If they can, why then not make it originally? Is the one more a
means to an end, than the other? If not, then the power to carry the mails may
be obstructed; nay, may be annihilated by the neglect of a state.

upon the will, or the pleasure of the states?

§ 1136.
</b>
It has been said, that when once a
state-road is made a post-road by an act of congress, the national government
have acquired such an interest in the use of it, that it is not competent for
the state authorities to obstruct it. But how can this be made out? If the power
of congress is merely to select or designate the mail-roads, what interest in
the use is acquired by the national government any more, than by any travellers
upon the road? Where is the power given to acquire it? Can it be pretended, that
a state may not discontinue a road, after it has been once established, as a
mail-road? The power has been constantly exercised by the states ever since the
adoption of the constitution. The states have altered, and discontinued, and
changed such roads at their pleasure. It would be a most truly alarming inroad
upon state sovereignty to declare, that a state-road could never be altered or
discontinued after it had once become a mail-road. That would be to supersede
all state authority over their own roads. If the states can discontinue their
roads, why not obstruct them? Who shall compel them to repair them, when
discontinued, or to keep them at any time in good repair? No one ever yet
contended, that the national government possessed any such compulsive authority.
If, then, the states may alter or discontinue their roads, or suffer them to go
out of repair, is it not obvious, that the power to carry the mails may be
retarded or defeated in a great measure by this constitutional exercise of state
power? And, if it be the right and duty of congress to provide adequate means
for the transportation of the mails, wherever the public good requires it, what
limit is there to these means, other than that they are appropriate to the end?

§ 1137.
</b>
In point of fact, congress cannot
be said, in any exact sense, to have yet executed the power to establish
post-roads, if by that power we are to understand the designation of particular
state-roads, on which the mails shall be carried. The general course has been to
designate merely the towns, between which the mails shall be carried, without
ascertaining the particular roads at all. Thus, the Act of 20th of February,
1799, ch. 7, (which is but a sample of the other acts,) declares, that "the
following roads be established, as post-roads, namely, from Wiscasset in the
District of Maine to Savannah in Georgia, by the following route, to wit:
Portland, Portsmouth, Newburyport, Ipswich, Salem, Boston, Worcester," &amp;c.
&amp;c.; without pointing out any road between those places, on which it should
be carried. There are different roads from several of these places to the
others. Suppose one of these roads should be discontinued, could the
mail-carriers insist upon travelling it?
</p>

<b>
§ 1138.
</b>
The truth is, that congress have
hitherto acted under the power to a very limited extent only; and will forever
continue to do so from principles of public policy and economy, except in cases
of an extraordinary nature. There can be no motive to use the power, except for
the public good; and circumstances may render it indispensable to carry it out
in particular cases to its full limits. It has already occurred, and may
hereafter occur, that post-roads may be important and necessary for the purpose
of the Union, in peace as well as in war, between places, where there is not any
good state-road, and where the amount of travel would not justify any state in
an expenditure equal to the construction of such a state-road.
<a href="#024">

<sup>

</b>
</a>
In such cases, as the benefit is for the Union, the burthen ought to be borne by
the Union. Without any invidious distinction, it may be stated, that the winter
mail-route between Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and Washington, by the way of
the Susquehannah and Havre de Grace, has been before congress under this very
aspect. There is no one, who will doubt the importance of the best post-road in
that direction; (the nearest between the two cities;) and yet it is obvious,
that the nation alone can be justly called upon to provide the road.

<b>
§ 1139.
</b>
Let a case be taken, when state
policy or state hostility shall lead the legislature to close up, or discontinue
a road, the nearest and the best between two great states, rivals perhaps for
the trade and intercourse of a third state, shall it be said, that congress has
no right to make, or repair a road for keeping open for the mail the best means
of communication between those states? May the national government be compelled
to take the most inconvenient and indirect routes for the mail?
<a href="#025">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
In other words, have the states a power to say, how, and upon what roads the
mails shall, and shall not travel? If so, then in relation to post-roads, the
states, and not the Union, are supreme.

§ 1140.
</b>
But it is said, that it would be
dangerous to allow any power in the Union to lay out and construct post-roads;
for then the exercise of the power would supercede the state jurisdiction. This
is an utter mistake. If congress should lay out and construct a post-road in a
state, it would still be a road within the ordinary territorial jurisdiction of
the state. The state could not, indeed, supercede, or obstruct, or discontinue
it, or prevent the Union from repairing it, or the mails from travelling on it.
But subject to these incidental rights, the right of territory and jurisdiction,
civilly and criminally, would be complete and perfect in the state. The power of
congress over the road would be limited to the mere right of passage and
preservation. That of the state would be general, and embrace all other objects.
Congress undoubtedly has power to purchase lands in a state for any public
purposes, such as forts, arsenals, and dock-yards. So, they have a right to
erect hospitals, custom-houses, and courthouses in a state. But no person ever
imagined, that these places were thereby removed from the general jurisdiction
of the state. On the contrary, they are universally understood for all other
purposes, not inconsistent with the constitutional rights and uses of the Union,
to be subject to state authority and rights.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1141">

<b>
§ 1141.
</b>
The clause respecting cessions of
territory for the seat of government, and for forts, arsenals, dockyards, &amp;c.
has nothing to do with the point. But if it had, it is favourable to the power.
That clause was necessary for the purpose of ousting the state jurisdiction in
the specified cases, and for vesting an
<i>
exclusive
</i>
jurisdiction in the
general government. No general or
<i>
exclusive
</i>
jurisdiction is either
required, or would be useful in regard to post-roads. It would be inconvenient
for congress to assemble in a place, where it had not exclusive jurisdiction.
And an exclusive jurisdiction would seem indispensable over forts, arsenals,
dock-yards, and other places of a like nature. But surely it will not be
pretended, that congress could not erect a fort, or magazine, in a place within
a state, unless the state should cede the territory. The only effect would be,
that the jurisdiction in such a case would not be exclusive. Suppose a state
should prohibit a sale of any of the lands within its boundaries by its own
citizens, for any public purposes indispensable for the Union, either military
or civil, would not congress possess a constitutional right to demand, and
appropriate land within the state for such purposes, making a just compensation?
Exclusive jurisdiction over a road is one thing; the right to make it is quite
another. A turnpike company may be authorized to make a road; and yet may have
no jurisdiction, or at least no exclusive jurisdiction over it.

proves nothing. That work
was principally designed to meet objections, and remove prejudices. The

§ 1144.
</b>
This question, as to the right to
lay out and construct post-roads, is wholly distinct from that of the more
general power to lay out and make canals, and military and other roads. The
latter power may not exist at all; even if the former should be unquestionable.
The latter turns upon a question of implied power, as incident to given powers.
<a href="#027">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
The former turns upon the true
interpretation of words of express grant. Nobody doubts, that the words "establish
post-roads," may, without violating their received meaning in other cases,
be construed so, as to include the power to lay out and construct roads. The
question is, whether that is the true sense of the words, as used in the
constitution. And here, if ever, the rule of interpretation, which requires us
to look at the nature of the instrument, and the objects of the power, as a
national power, in order to expound its meaning, must come into operation.

§ 1145.
</b>
But whatever be the extent of the
power, narrow or large, there will still remain another inquiry, whether it is
an exclusive power, or concurrent in the states. This is not, perhaps, a very
important inquiry, because it is admitted on all sides, that it can be exercised
only in subordination to the power of congress, if it be concurrent in the
states. A learned commentator deems it concurrent, inasmuch as there seems
nothing in the constitution, or in the nature of the thing itself, which may not
be exercised by both governments at the same time, without prejudice or
interference; but subordinate, because, whenever any power is expressly granted
to congress, it is to be taken for granted, that it is not to be contravened by
the authority of any particular state. A state might, therefore, establish a
post-road, or post-office, on any route, where congress had not established any.
<a href="#028">

<sup>

</b>
</a>
On the other hand, another learned
commentator is of opinion, that the power is exclusive in congress, so far as
relates to the conveyance of letters, &amp;c.
<a href="#029">
<b>
<sup>

</b>
</a>
It is highly improbable, that any state will attempt any exercise of the power,
considering the difficulty of carrying it into effect, without the co-operation
of congress.

<li><a id="013"></a>Aware of the difficulties attendantupon this extremely strict construction, another has been attempted, which ismore liberal, but whichit has been thought (as will be hereafter seen) tosurrender the substance of the argument. It will be most satisfactory to give itin the very words of its most distinguished advocate: "The first of these grants is in the following words:'Congress shall have power to establish post-offices and post-roads.' What isthe just import of these words, and the extent of the grant? The word'establish' is the ruling term; 'post-offices and post-roads' are the subjects,on which it acts. The question, therefore, is, what power is granted by thatword? The sense, in which words are commonly used, is that, in which they are tobe understood in all transactions between public bodies and individuals. Theintention of the parties is to prevail, and there is no better way ofascertaining it, than by giving to the terms used their ordinary import. If wewere to ask any number of our most enlightened citizens, who had no connexionwith public affairs, and whose minds were unprejudiced, what was the import ofthe word, 'establish,' and the extent of the grant, which it controls, we do notthink, that there would be any difference of opinion among them. We aresatisfied, that all of them would answer, that a power was thereby given tocongress to fix on the towns, court-houses, and other places, throughout ourUnion, at which there should be post-offices; the routes, by which the mailsshould be carried from one post-office to another so as to diffuse intelligenceas extensively, and to make the institution as useful, as possible; to fix thepostage to be paid on every letter and packet thus carried to support theestablishment; and to protect the post-offices and mails from robbery, bypunishing those, who should commit the offence. The idea of a right to lay offthe roads of the United States, on a general scale of improvement; to take thesoil from the proprietor by force; to establish turnpikes end tolls, and topunish offenders in the manner stated above, would never occur to any suchperson. The use of the existing road, by the stage, mail-carrier, or post-boy,in passing over it, as others do, is all, that would be thought of; thejurisdiction and soil remaining to the state, with a right in the state, orthose authorized by its legislature, to change the road at pleasure. "The intention of the parties is supported by otherproof, which ought to place it beyond all doubt. In the former act ofgovernment, (the confederation,) we find a grant for the same purpose, expressedin the following words: 'The United States, in congress assembled, shall havethe sole and exclusive right and power of establishing and regulatingpost-offices from one state to another, throughout the United States, and ofexacting such postage on the papers passing through the same asmay berequisite to defray the expenses of the said post-office.' The term 'establish'was likewise the ruling one in that instrument and was evidently intended andunderstood to give a power simply and solely to fix where there should bepost-offices. By transferring this term from the confederation into theconstitution it was doubtless intended that it should be understood in the samesense in the latter that it was in the former instrument and to be applied aliketo post-offices and post-roads. In whatever sense it is applied to post-officesit most be applied in the same sense to post-roads. But it may be asked, if suchwas the intention, why were not all the other terms of the grant transferredwith it? The reason is obvious. The confederation being a bond of union betweenindependent states, it was necessary, in granting the powers, which were to beexercised over them, to be very explicit and minute in defining the powersgranted. But the constitution, to the extent of its powers, having incorporatedthe states into one government, like the government of the states, individually,fewer words, in defining the powers granted by it, were not only adequate, butperhaps better adapted to the purpose. We find, that brevity is a characteristicof the instrument. Had it been intended to convey a more enlarged power in theconstitution, than had been granted in the confederation, surely the samecontrolling term would not have been used; or other words would have been added,to show such intention, and to mark the extent, to which the power should becarried. It is a liberal construction of the powers granted in the constitutionby this term, to include in it all the powers, that were granted in theconfederation by terms, which specifically defined, and (as was supposed)extended their limits. It would be absurd to say, that, by omitting from theconstitution any portion of the phraseology, which was deemed important in theconfederation. the import of that term was enlarged, and with it the powers ofthe constitution, in a proportional degree, beyond what they were in theconfederation. The right to exact postage and to protect the post-offices andmails from robbery by punishing the offenders, may fairly be considered, asincidents to the grant, since, without it, the object of the grant might bedefeated. Whatever is absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of the objectof the grant, though not specified, may fairly be considered as included in it.Beyond this the doctrine of incidental power cannot be carried. "If we go back to the origin of our settlements andinstitutions, and trace their progress down to the Revolution, we shall see,that it was in this sense and in none other, that the power was exercised by allourcolonial governments. Post-offices were made for the country, and not thecountry for them. They are the offspring of improvement. They never go beforeit. Settlements are first made; after which the progress is uniform and simple,extending to objects in regular order, most necessary to the comfort of man;schools, places of public worship, court-houses, and markets; post-officesfollow. Roads may, indeed, be said to he coeval with settlements. They lead toall the places mentioned, and to every other, which the various and complicatedinterests of society require. "It is believed that not one example can be given,from the first settlement of our country to the adoption of this constitution,of a post-office being established, without a view to existing roads; or of asingle road having been made by pavement, turnpike. &c. for the sole purposeof accommodating a post-office. Such, too, is the uniform progress of allsocieties. In granting then this power to the United States, it was,undoubtedly, intended by the framers and ratifiers of the constitution, toconvey it in the sense and extent only, in which it had been understood andexercised by the previous authorities of the country. "This conclusion is confirmed by the object of thegrant and the manner of its execution. The object is the transportation of themail throughout the United States, which may be done on horse-back, and was sodone, until lately, since the establishment of stages. Between the great towns,and in other places, where the population is dense, stages are preferred,because they afford an additional opportunity to make a profit from passengers.But where the population is sparse, and on cross roads, it is generally carriedon horseback. Unconnected with passengers and other objects, it cannot bedoubted, that the mail itself may be carried in every part of our Union, withnearly as much economy, and greater despatch, on horseback, than in a stage; andin many parts with much greater. In every part of the Union in which stages canbe preferred, the roads are sufficiently good, provided those, which serve forevery other purpose, will accommodate them. In every other part, where horsesalone are used, if other people pass them on horseback, surely the mail carriercan. For an object so simple and so easy in the execution, it would, doubtless,excite surprise if it should be thought proper to appoint commissioners to layoff the country on a great scheme of improvement, with the power to shortendistances, reduce heights, level mountains, and pave surfaces. "If the United States possessed the power contendedfor under this grant, might they not, in adopting the roads of the individualstates forthe carriage of the mail, as has been done, assume jurisdiction overthem, and preclude a right to interfere with or alter them? Might they notestablish turnpikes, and exercise all the other acts of sovereignty, abovestated, over such roads, necessary to protect them from injury, and defray theexpense of repairing them? Surely, if the right exists, these consequencesnecessarily followed, as soon as the road was established. The absurdity of sucha pretension must be apparent to all, who examine it. In this way, a largeportion of the territory of every state might be taken from it; for there isscarcely a road in any state, which will not be used for the transportation ofthe mail. A new field for legislation and internal government would thus beopened." President Monroe's Message, of 4th May, 1822, p. 24 to 27.</li>
