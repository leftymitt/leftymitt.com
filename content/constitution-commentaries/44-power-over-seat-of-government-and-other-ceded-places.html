This clause was not in the original
draft of the constitution; but was referred to a committee, who reported in its
favour; and it was adopted into the constitution with a slight amendment without
any apparent objection.

§ 1213.
</b>
The indispensable necessity of
complete and exclusive power, on the part of the congress, at the seat of
government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exercised by every
legislature of the Union, and one might say of the World, by virtue of its
general supremacy. Without it not only the public authorities might be insulted,
and their proceedings be interrupted with impunity; but the public archives
might be in danger of violation, and destruction, and a dependence of the
members of the national government on the state authorities for protection in
the discharge of their functions be created, which would bring on the national
councils the imputation of being subjected to undue awe and influence, and
might, in times of high excitement, expose their lives to jeopardy. It never
could be safe to leave in possession of any state the exclusive power to decide,
whether the functionaries of the national government should have the moral or
physical power to perform their duties.
<a href="#002">

</a>
It might subject the favoured state to the most unrelenting jealousy of the
other states, and introduce earnest controversies from time to time respecting
the removal of the seat of government.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1214">
</a>
<b>
§ 1214.
</b>
Nor can the cession be justly an
object of jealousy to any state; or in the slightest degree impair its
sovereignty. The ceded district is of a very narrow extent; and it rests in the
option of the state, whether it shall be made or not. There can be little doubt,
that the inhabitants composing it would receive with thankfulness such a
blessing, since their own importance would be thereby increased, their interests
be subserved, and their rights be under the immediate protection of the
representatives of the whole Union.

It
is not improbable, that an occurrence, at the very close of the revolutionary
war, had a great effect in introducing this provision into the constitution. At
the period alluded to, the congress, then sitting at Philadelphia, was
surrounded and insulted by a small, but insolent body of mutineers of the
continental army. Congress applied to the executive authority of Pennsylvania
for defence; but, under the ill-conceived constitution of the state at that
time, the executive power was vested in a council consisting of thirteen
members; and they possessed, or exhibited so little energy, and such apparent
intimidation, that congress indignantly removed to New-Jersey, whose inhabitants
welcomed them with promises of defending them. Congress remained for some time
at Princeton without being again insulted, till, for the sake of greater
convenience, they adjourned to Annapolis. The general dissatisfaction with the
proceedings of Pennsylvania, and the degrading spectacle of a fugitive congress,
were sufficiently striking to produce this remedy.

§ 1215.
</b>
And yet this clause did not escape
the common fate of most of the powers of the national government. It was
represented, as peculiarly dangerous. It may, it was said, become a soft of
public sanctuary, with exclusive privileges and immunities of every sort. It may
be the very spot for the establishment of tyranny, mid of refuge of the
oppressors of the people. The inhabitants will be answerable to no laws, except
those of congress. A powerful army may be here kept on foot; and the most
oppressive and sanguinary laws may be passed to govern the district.

Nay, at the distance of fourteen years
after the constitution had quietly gone into operation, and this power had been
acted upon with a moderation, as commendable, as it ought to be satisfactory, a
learned commentator expressed regret at the extent of the power, and intimated
in no inexplicit terms his fears for the future. "A system of laws,"
says he, "incompatible with the nature and principles of a representative
democracy, though not likely to be introduced at once, may be matured by
degrees, and diffuse its influence through the states, and finally lay the
foundation of the most important changes in the nature of the federal
government. Let foreigners be enabled to hold lands, and transmit them by
inheritance, or devise; let the preference to males, and the rights or
primogeniture he revived with the doctrine of entails; and aristocracy will
neither want a ladder to climb by, nor a base for its support.

<a id="1216">
</a>
<b>
§ 1216.
</b>
What a superstructure to be erected
on such a narrow foundation! Several or the states now permit foreigners to hold
and transmit lands; and yet their liberties are not overwhelmed. The whole
South, before the revolution, allowed and cherished the system of primogeniture;
and yet they possessed, and transmitted to their children their colonial rights
and privileges, and achieved under this very system the independence of the
country. The system of entails is still the law of several of the states; and
yet no danger has yet assailed them. They possess, and enjoy the fruits of
republican industry and frugality, without any landed or other aristocracy. And
yet the petty district of ten miles square is to overrule in its policy and
legislation all, that is venerable and admirable in state legislation! The
states, and the people of the states are represented in congress. The district
has no representatives there; but is subjected to the exclusive legislation of
the former. And yet congress, at home republican, will here nourish aristocracy.
The states will here lay the foundation for the destruction of their own
institutions, rights, and sovereignty. At home, they will follow the legislation
of the district, instead of guiding it by their precept and example. They will
choose to be the engines of tyranny and oppression in the district, that they
may become enslaved within their own territorial sovereignty. What, but a
disposition to indulge in all sorts of delusions and alarms, could create such
extraordinary flights of imagination? Can such things be, and overcome us, like
a summer's cloud, without our special wonder? At this distance of time, it seems
wholly unnecessary to refute the suggestions, which have been so ingeniously
urged. If they prove any thing, they prove, that there ought to be no
government, because no persons can be found worthy of the trust.

§ 1217.
</b>
The seat of government has now, for
more than thirty years, been permanently fixed on the river Potomac, on a tract
of ten miles square, ceded by the states of Virginia and Maryland. It was
selected by that great man, the boast of all America, the first in war, the
first in peace, and the first in the hearts of his countrymen. It bears his
name; it is the monument of his fame and wisdom. May it be for ever consecrated
to its present noble purpose,

<b>
§ 1218.
</b>
The inhabitants enjoy all their
civil, religious, and political rights. They live substantially under the same
laws, as at the time of the cession; such changes only having been made, as have
been devised, and sought by themselves. They are not indeed citizens of any
state, entitled to the privileges of such; but they are citizens of the United
States. They have no immediate representatives in congress. But they may justly
boast, that they live under a paternal government, attentive to their wants, and
zealous for their welfare. They, as yet, possess no local legislature; and have,
as yet, not desired to possess one. A learned commentator has doubted, whether
congress can create such a legislature, because it is the delegation of a
delegated authority.
<a href="#007">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
A very different
opinion was expressed by the Federalist; for it was said, that "a municipal
legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course
be allowed them."
<a href="#008">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
In point of
fact, the corporations of the three cities within its limits possess and
exercise a delegated power of legislation under their charters, granted by
congress, to the full extent of their municipal wants, without any
constitutional scruple, or surmise of doubt.

<a id="1219">

<b>
§ 1219.
</b>
The other part of the power, giving
exclusive legislation over places ceded for the erection of forts, magazines, &amp;c.,
seems still more necessary for the public convenience and safety. The public
money expended on such places, and the public property deposited in them, and
the nature of the military duties, which may be required there, all demand, that
they should be exempted from state authority. In truth, it would be wholly
improper, that places, on which the security of the entire Union may depend,
should be subjected to the control of any member of it. The power, indeed, is
wholly unexceptionable; since it can only be exercised at the will of the state;
and therefore it is placed beyond all reasonable scruple.
<a href="#009">

</a>
Yet, it did not escape without the scrutinizing jealousy of the opponents of the
constitution, and was denounced, as dangerous to state sovereignty.

§ 1220.
</b>
A great variety of cessions have
been made by the states under this power. And generally there has been a
reservation of the right to serve all state process, civil and criminal, upon
persons found therein. This reservation has not been thought at all inconsistent
with the provision of the constitution; for the state process,
<i>
quoad hoc
</i>
,
becomes the process of the United States, and the general power of exclusive
legislation remains with congress. Thus, these places are not capable of being
made a sanctuary for fugitives, to exempt them from acts done within, and
cognizable by, the states, to which the territory belonged; and at the same time
congress is enabled to accomplish the great objects of the power.

§ 1221.
</b>
The power of Congress to exercise
exclusive jurisdiction over these ceded places is conferred on that body, as the
legislature of the Union; and cannot be exercised in any other character. A law
passed in pursuance of it is the supreme law of the land, and binding on all the
states, and cannot be defeated by them. The power to pass such a law carries
with it all the incidental powers to give it complete and effectual execution;
and such a law may be extended in its operation incidentally throughout the
United States, if congress think it necessary so to do. But. if intended to have
efficiency beyond the district, language must be used in the act expressive of
such an intention; otherwise it will be deemed purely local.

<a id="1222">

<b>
§ 1222.
</b>
It follows from this review of the
clause, that the states cannot take cognizance of any acts done in the ceded
places after the cession; and, on the other hand, the inhabitants of those
places cease to be inhabitants of the state, and can no longer exercise any
civil or political rights under the laws of the state.
<a href="#013">
<b>
<sup>
13
</sup>
</b>
</a>
But if there has been no cession by the state of the place, although it has been
constantly occupied and used, under purchase, or otherwise, by the United States
for a fort, arsenal, or other constitutional purpose, the state jurisdiction
still remains complete and perfect.

§ 1223.
</b>
Upon a recent occasion, the nature
and effect of the exclusive power of legislation, thus given by the constitution
in these ceded places, came under the consideration of the Supreme Court, and
was much discussed. It was argued, that all such legislation by congress was
purely local, like that exercised by a territorial legislature; and was not to
be deemed legislation by congress in the character of the legislature of the
Union. The object of the argument was to establish, that a law, made in or for
such ceded places, had no extra-territorial force or obligation, it not being a
law of the United States. The reasoning of the court affirming, that such an act
was a law of the United States, and that congress in passing it acted, as the
legislature of the Union, can be best conveyed in their own language, and would
be impaired by an abridgment.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1224">
</a>
<b>
§ 1224.
</b>
"In the enumeration of the
powers of congress, which is made in the eighth section of the first article, we
find that of exercising exclusive legislation over such district, as shall
become the seat of government. This power, like all others, which are specified,
is conferred on congress, as the legislature of the Union; for, strip them of
that character, and they would not possess it. In no other character can it be
exercised. In legislating for the district, they necessarily preserve the
character of the legislature of the Union; for it is in that character alone,
that the constitution confers on them this power of exclusive legislation. This
proposition need not be enforced. The second clause of the sixth article
declares, that 'this constitution, and the laws of the United States, which
shall be made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land.' The
clause, which gives exclusive jurisdiction, is unquestionably a part of the
constitution, and, as such, binds all the United States. Those, who contend,
that acts of congress, made in pursuance of this power, do not, like acts made
in pursuance of other powers, bind the nation, ought to show some safe and clear
rule, which shall support this construction, and prove, that an act of congress,
clothed in all the forms, which attend other legislative acts, and passed in
virtue of a power conferred on, and exercised by congress, as the legislature of
the Union, is not a law of the United States, and does not bind them.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1225">
</a>
<b>
§ 1225.
</b>
"One of the gentlemen sought
to illustrate his proposition, that congress, when legislating for the district,
assumed a distinct character, and was reduced to a mere local legislature, whose
laws could possess no obligation out of the ten miles square, by a reference to
the complex character of this court. It is, they say, a court of common law, and
a court of equity. Its character, when sitting as a court of common law, is as
distinct from its character, when sitting as a court of equity, as if the powers
belonging to those departments were vested in different tribunals. Though united
in the same tribunal, they are never confounded with each other. Without
inquiring, how far the union of different characters in one court may be
applicable, in principle, to the union in congress of the power of exclusive
legislation in some places, and of limited legislation in others, it may be
observed, that the forms of proceedings in a court of law are so totally unlike
the forms of proceedings in a court of equity, that a mere inspection of the
record gives decisive information of the character, in which the court sits, and
consequently of the extent of its powers. But if the forms of proceeding were
precisely the same, and the court the same, the distinction would disappear.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1226">
</a>
<b>
§ 1226.
</b>
"Since congress legislates in
the same forms, and in the same character, in virtue of powers of equal
obligation conferred in the same instrument, when exercising its exclusive
powers of legislation, as well as when exercising those, which are limited, we
must inquire, whether there be any thing in the nature of this exclusive
legislation, which necessarily confines the operation of the laws, made in
virtue of this power, to the place, with a view to which they are made.
Connected with the power to legislate within this district, is a similar power
in forts, arsenals, dock-yards, &amp;c. Congress has a right to punish murder
in, a fort, or other place within its exclusive jurisdiction; but no general
right to punish murder committed within any of the states. In the act for the
punishment of crimes against the United States, murder committed within a fort,
or any other place or district of country, under the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States, is punished with death. Thus congress
legislates in the same act, under its exclusive and its limited powers.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1227">
</a>
<b>
§ 1227.
</b>
"The act proceeds to direct,
that the body of the criminal, after execution, may be delivered to a surgeon
for dissection, and, punishes any person, who shall rescue such body during its
conveyance from the place of execution to the surgeon, to whom it is to be
delivered. Let these actual provisions of the law, or any other provisions,
which can be made on the subject, be considered with a view to the character, in
which congress acts, when exercising its powers of exclusive legislation. If
congress is to be considered merely as a local legislature, invested, as to this
object, with powers limited to the fort, or other place, in which the murder may
be committed, if its general powers cannot come in aid of these local powers,
how can the offence be tried in any other court, than that of the place, in
which it has been committed? How can the offender be conveyed to, or tried in,
any other place? How can he be executed elsewhere? How can his body be conveyed
through a country under the jurisdiction of another sovereign, and the
individual punished, who, within that jurisdiction, shall rescue the body? Were
any one state of the Union to pass a law for trying a criminal in a court not
created by itself, in a place not within its jurisdiction, and direct the
sentence to be executed without its territory, we should all perceive, and
acknowledge its incompetency to such a course of legislation. If congress be not
equally incompetent, it is, because that body unites the powers of local
legislation with those, which are to operate through the Union, and may use the
last in aid of the first; or, because the power of exercising exclusive
legislation draws after it, as an incident, the power of making that legislation
effectual; and the incidental power may be exercised throughout the Union,
because the principal power is given to that body, as the legislature of the
Union.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1228">
</a>
<b>
§ 1228.
</b>
"So, in the same act, a
person, who, having knowledge of the commission of murder, or other felony, on
the high seas, or within any fort, arsenal, dockyard, magazine, or other place,
or district of country within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States, shall conceal the same, &amp;c. he shall be adjudged guilty of
misprision of felony, and shall be adjudged to be imprisoned, &amp;c. It is
clear, that congress cannot punish felonies generally; and, of consequence,
cannot punish misprision of felony. It is equally clear, that a state
legislature, the state of Maryland for example, cannot punish those, who, in
another state, conceal a felony committed in Maryland. How, then, is it, that
congress, legislating exclusively for a fort, punishes those, who, out of that
fort, conceal a felony committed within it?
</p>
<p>
<a id="1229">
</a>
<b>
§ 1229.
</b>
"The solution, and the only
solution of the difficulty, is, that the power vested in congress, as the
legislature of the United States, to legislate exclusively within any place
ceded by a state, carries with it, as an incident, the right to make that power
effectual. If a felon escape out of the state, in which the act has been
committed, the government cannot pursue him into another state, and apprehend
him there; but must demand him from the executive power of that other state. If
congress were to be considered merely, as the local legislature for the fort, or
other place, in which the offence might be committed, then this principle would
apply to them, as to other local legislatures; and the felon, who should escape
out of the fort, or other place, in which the felony may have been committed,
could not be apprehended by the marshal, but must be demanded from the executive
of the state. But we know, that the principle does not apply; and the reason is,
that congress is not a local legislature, but exercises this particular power,
like all its other powers, in its high character, as the legislature of the
Union. The American people thought it a necessary power, and they conferred it
for their own benefit. Being so conferred, it carries with it all those
incidental powers, which are necessary to its complete and effectual execution.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1230">
</a>
<b>
§ 1230.
</b>
"Whether any particular law be
designed to operate without the district or not, depends on the words of that
law. If it be designed so to operate, then the question, whether the power, so
exercised, be incidental to the power of exclusive legislation, and be warranted
by the constitution, requires a consideration of that instrument. In such cases
the constitution and the law must be compared and construed. This is the
exercise of jurisdiction. It is the only exercise of it, which is allowed in
such a case."
