§ 1254.
</b>
O

NE

of the
earliest and most important measures, which gave rise to a question of
constitutional power, was the act chartering the bank of the United States in
1791. That question has often since been discussed; and though the measure has
been repeatedly sanctioned by congress, by the executive, and by the judiciary,
and has obtained the like favour in a great majority of the states, yet it is,
up to this very hour, still debated upon constitutional grounds, as if it were
still new, and untried. It is impossible, at this time, to treat it, as an open
question, unless the constitution is for ever to remain an unsettled text,
possessing no permanent attributes, and incapable of having any ascertained
sense; varying with every change of doctrine, and of party; and delivered over
to interminable doubts. If the constitution is to be only, what the
administration of the day may wish it to be; and is to assume any, and all
shapes, which may suit the opinions and theories of public men, as they
successively direct the public councils, it will be difficult, indeed, to
ascertain, what its real value is. It cannot possess either certainty, or
uniformity, or safety. It will be one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow,
and again another thing on each succeeding day. The past will furnish no guide,
and the future no security. It will be the reverse of a law; and entail upon the
country the curse of that miserable servitude, so much abhorred and denounced,
where all is vague and uncertain in the fundamentals of government.

§ 1255.
</b>
The reasoning, upon which the
constitutionality of a national bank is denied, has been already in some degree
stated in the preceding remarks. It turns upon the strict interpretation of the
clause, giving the auxiliary powers necessary, and proper to execute the other
enumerated powers. It is to the following effect: The power to incorporate a
bank is not among those enumerated in the constitution. It is known, that the
very power, thus proposed, as a means, was rejected, as an end, by the
convention, which formed the constitution. A proposition was made in that body,
to authorize congress to open canals, and an amendatory one to empower them to
create corporations. But the whole was rejected; and one of the reasons of the
rejection urged in debate was, that they then would have a power to create a
bank, which would render the great cities, where there were prejudices and
jealousies on that subject, adverse to the adoption of the constitution.
</p>

</a>
In the next place, all the enumerated
powers can be carried into execution without a bank. A bank, therefore, is not
<i>
necessary,
</i>
and consequently not authorized by this clause of the
constitution. It is urged, that a bank will give great facility, or convenience
to the collection of taxes. If this were true, yet the constitution allows only
the means, which are
<i>
necessary,
</i>
and not merely those, which are
<i>
convenient
</i>
for effecting the enumerated powers. If such a latitude of construction were
allowed, as to consider convenience, as justifying the use of such means, it
would swallow up all the enumerated powers.
<a href="#002">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
Therefore, the constitution restrains
congress to those means, without which the power would be nugatory.

§ 1256.
</b>
Nor can its convenience be
satisfactorily established. Bank-bills may be a more convenient vehicle, than
treasury orders, for the purposes of that department. But a little difference in
the degree of convenience cannot constitute the necessity contemplated by the
constitution. Besides; the local and state banks now in existence are competent,
and would be willing to undertake all the agency required for those very
purposes by the government. And if they are able and willing, this establishes
clearly, that there can be no necessity for establishing a national bank.
<a href="#004">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
If there would ever be a superior
conveniency in a national bank, it does not follow, that there exists a power to
establish it, or that the business of the country cannot go on very well without
it. Can it be thought, that the constitution intended, that for a shade or two
of convenience, more or less, congress should be authorized to break down the
most ancient and fundamental laws of the states, such as those against mortmain,
the laws of alienage, the rules of descent, the acts of distribution, the laws
of escheat and forfeiture, and the laws of monopoly? Nothing but a necessity,
invincible by any other means, can justify such a prostration of laws, which
constitute the pillars of our whole system of jurisprudence.
<a href="#005">

<sup>

</b>
</a>
If congress have the power to create one corporation, they may create all sorts;
for the power is no where limited; and may even establish monopolies.
<a href="#006">

</a>
Indeed this very charter is a
monopoly.

<b>
§ 1257.
</b>
The reasoning, by which the
constitutionality of the national bank has been sustained, is contained in the
following summary. The powers confided to the national government are
unquestionably, so far as they exist, sovereign and supreme.
<a href="#008">
<b>
<sup>
8
</sup>
</b>
</a>
It is not, and cannot be disputed, that the power of creating a corporation is
one belonging to sovereignty. But so are all other legislative powers; for the
original power of giving the law on any subject whatever is a sovereign power.
If the national government cannot create a corporation, because it is an
exercise of sovereign power, neither can it, for the same reason, exercise any
other legislative power.
<a href="#009">
<b>
<sup>
9
</sup>
</b>
</a>
This
consideration alone ought to put an end to the abstract inquiry, whether the
national government has power to erect a corporation, that is, to give a legal
or artificial capacity to one or more persons, distinct from the natural
capacity.
<a href="#010">
<b>
<sup>
10
</sup>
</b>
</a>
For, if it be an incident to
sovereignty, and it is not prohibited, it must belong to the national government
in relation to the objects entrusted to it. The true difference is this; where
the authority of a government is general, it can create corporations in all
cases; where it is confined to certain branches of legislation, it can create
corporations only as to those cases.
<a href="#011">
<b>
<sup>
11
</sup>
</b>
</a>
It cannot be denied, that implied powers may be delegated, as well as express.
It follows, that a power to erect corporations may as well be implied, as any
other thing, if it be an instrument or means of carrying into execution any
specified power. The only question in any case must be, whether it be such an
instrument or means, and have a natural relation to any of the acknowledged
objects of government. Thus, congress may not erect a corporation for
superintending the police of the city of Philadelphia, because they have no
authority to regulate the police of that city. But if they possessed the
authority to regulate the police of such city, they might, unquestionably,
create a corporation for that purpose; because it is incident to the sovereign
legislative power to regulate a thing, to employ all the means, which relate to
its regulation, to the best and greatest advantage.

<a id="1258">
</a>
<b>
§ 1258.
</b>
A strange fallacy has crept into
the reasoning on this subject. It has been supposed, that a corporation is some
great, independent thing; and that the power to erect it is a great,
substantive, independent power; whereas, in truth, a corporation is but a legal
capacity, quality, or means to an end; and the power to erect it is, or may be,
an implied and incidental power. A corporation is never the end, for which other
powers are exercised; but a means, by which other objects are accomplished. No
contributions are made to charity for the sake of an incorporation; but a
corporation is created to administer the charity. No seminary of learning is
instituted in order to be incorporated; but the corporate character is conferred
to subserve the purposes of education. No city was ever built with the sole
object of being incorporated; but it is incorporated as affording the best means
of being well governed. So a mercantile company is formed with a certain capital
for carrying on a particular branch of business. Here, the business to be
prosecuted is the end. The association, in order to form the requisite capital,
is the primary means. If an incorporation is added to the association, it only
gives it a new quality, an artificial capacity, by which it is enabled to
prosecute the business with more convenience and safety. In truth, the power of
creating a corporation is never used for its own sake; but for the purpose of
effecting something else. So that there is not a shadow of reason to say, that
it may not pass as an incident to powers expressly given, as a mode of executing
them.

§ 1259.
</b>
It is true, that among the
enumerated powers we do not find that of establishing a bank, or creating a
corporation. But we do find there the great powers to lay and collect taxes; to
borrow money; to regulate commerce; to declare and conduct war; and to raise and
support armies and navies. Now, if a bank be a fit means to execute any or all
of these powers, it is just as much implied, as any other means. If it be "necessary
and proper" for any of them, how is it possible to deny the authority to
create it for such purposes?
<a href="#014">
<b>
<sup>
14
</sup>
</b>
</a>
There is
no more propriety in giving this power in
<i>
express
</i>
terms, than in giving
any other incidental powers or means in express terms. If it had been intended
to grant this power generally, and to make it a distinct and independent power,
having no relation to, but reaching beyond the other enumerated powers, there
would then have been a propriety in giving it in express terms, for otherwise it
would not exist. Thus, it was proposed in the convention, to give a general
power "to grant charters of incorporation;" — to "grant
charters of incorporation in cases, where the public good may require them, and
the authority of a single state may be incompetent;"
<a href="#015">
<b>
<sup>
15
</sup>
</b>
</a>
— and "to grant letters of incorporation for canals, &amp;c."
<a href="#016">
<b>
<sup>
16
</sup>
</b>
</a>
If either of these propositions had
been adopted, there would have been an obvious propriety in giving the power in
express terms; because, as to the two former, the power was general and
unlimited, and reaching far beyond any of the other enumerated powers; and as to
the latter, it might be far more extensive than any incident to the other
enumerated powers.
<a href="#017">
<b>
<sup>
17
</sup>
</b>
</a>
But the rejection
of these propositions does not prove, that congress in no case, as an incident
to the enumerated powers, should erect a corporation; but only, that they should
not have a substantive, independent power to erect corporations beyond those
powers.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1260">
</a>
<b>
§ 1260.
</b>
Indeed, it is most manifest, that
it never could have been contemplated by the convention, that congress should,
in no case, possess the power to erect a corporation. What otherwise would
become of the territorial governments, all of which are corporations created by
congress? There is no where an express power given to congress to erect them.
But under the confederation, congress did provide for their erection, as a
resulting and implied right of sovereignty, by the celebrated ordinance of 1787;
and congress, under the constitution, have ever since, without question, and
with the universal approbation of the nation, from time to time created
territorial governments. Yet congress derive this power only by implication, or
as necessary and proper, to carry into effect the express power to regulate the
territories of the United States.
<a href="#018">
<b>
<sup>
18
</sup>
</b>
</a>
In
the convention, two propositions were made and referred to a committee at the
same time with the propositions already stated respecting granting of charters,
"to dispose of the unappropriated lands of the United States," and "to
institute temporary governments for new states arising therein." Both these
propositions shared the same fate, as those respecting charters of
incorporation. But what would be thought of the argument, built upon this
foundation, that congress did not possess the power to erect territorial
governments, because these propositions were silently abandoned, or annulled in
the convention?
</p>
<p>
<a id="1261">
</a>
<b>
§ 1261.
</b>
This is not the only case, in which
congress may erect corporations. Under the power to accept a cession of
territory for the seat of government, and to exercise exclusive legislation
therein; no one can doubt, that congress may erect corporations therein, not
only public, but private corporations.
<a href="#019">
<b>
<sup>
19
</sup>
</b>
</a>
They have constantly exercised the power; and it has never yet been breathed,
that it was unconstitutional. Yet it can be exercised only as an incident to the
power of general legislation. And if so, why may it not be exercised, as an
incident to any specific power of legislation, if it be a means to attain the
objects of such power?
</p>
<p>
<a id="1262">
</a>
<b>
§ 1262.
</b>
That a national bank is an
appropriate means to carry into effect some of the enumerated powers of the
government, and that this can be best done by erecting it into a corporation,
may be established by the most satisfactory reasoning. It has a relation, more
or less direct, to the power of collecting taxes, to that of borrowing money, to
that of regulating trade between the states, and to those of raising and
maintaining fleets and armies.
<a href="#020">
<b>
<sup>
20
</sup>
</b>
</a>
And it may be added, that it has a
most important bearing upon the regulation of currency between the states. It is
an instrument, which has been usually applied by governments in the
administration of their fiscal and financial operations.
<a href="#021">
<b>
<sup>
21
</sup>
</b>
</a>
And in the present times it can hardly require argument to prove, that it is a
convenient, a useful, and an essential instrument in the fiscal operations of
the government of the United States.
<a href="#022">
<b>
<sup>
22
</sup>
</b>
</a>
This is so generally admitted by sound and intelligent statesmen, that it would
be a waste of time to endeavour to establish the truth by an elaborate survey of
the mode, in which it touches the administration of all the various branches of
the powers of the government.

§ 1263.
</b>
In regard to the suggestion, that a
proposition was made, and rejected in the convention to confer this very power,
what was the precise nature or extent of this proposition, or what were the
reasons for refusing it, cannot now be ascertained by any authentic document, or
even by any accurate recollection of the members. As far as any document exists,
it specifies only canals.
<a href="#024">
<b>
<sup>
24
</sup>
</b>
</a>
If this
proves any thing, it proves no more, than that it was thought inexpedient to
give a power to incorporate for the purpose of opening canals generally. But
very different accounts are given of the import of the proposition, and of the
motives for rejecting it. Some affirm, that it was confined to the opening of
canals and obstructions of rivers; others, that it embraced banks; and others,
that it extended to the power of incorporations generally. Some, again, allege,
that it was disagreed to, because it was thought improper to vest in congress a
power of erecting corporations; others, because they thought it unnecessary to
specify the power; and inexpedient to furnish an additional topic of objection
to the constitution. In this state of the matter, no inference whatever can be
drawn from it.
<a href="#025">
<b>
<sup>
25
</sup>
</b>
</a>
But, whatever may have
been the private intentions of the framers of the constitution, which can rarely
be established by the mere fact of their votes, it is certain, that the true
rule of interpretation is to ascertain the public and just intention from the
language of the instrument itself, according to the common rules applied to all
laws. The people, who adopted the constitution, could know nothing of the
private intentions of the framers. They adopted it upon its own clear import,
upon its own naked text. Nothing is more common, than for a law to effect more
or less, than the intention of the persons, who framed it; and it must be judged
of by its words and sense, and not by any private intentions of members of the
legislature.

§ 1264.
</b>
In regard to the faculties of the
bank, if congress could constitutionally create it, they might confer on it such
faculties and powers, as were fit to make it an appropriate means for fiscal
operations. They had a right to adapt it in the best manner to its end. No one
can pretend, that its having the faculty of holding a capital; of lending and
dealing in money; of issuing bank notes; of receiving deposits; and of
appointing suitable officers to manage its affairs; are not highly useful and
expedient, and appropriate to the purposes of a bank. They are just such, as are
usually granted to state banks; and just such, as give increased facilities to
all its operations. To say, that the bank might have gone on without this or
that faculty, is nothing. Who, but congress, shall say, how few, or how many it
shall have, if all are still appropriate to it, as an instrument of government,
and may make it more convenient, and more useful in its operations? No man can
say, that a single faculty in any national charter is useless, or irrelevant, or
strictly improper, that is conducive to its end, as a national instrument.
Deprive a bank of its trade and business, and its vital principles are
destroyed. Its form may remain, but its substance is gone. All the powers given
to the bank are to give efficacy to its functions of trade and business.

<a id="1265">

<b>
§ 1265.
</b>
As to another suggestion, that the
same objects might have been accomplished through the state banks, it is
sufficient to say, that no trace can be found in the constitution of any
intention to create a dependence on the states, or state institutions, for the
execution of its great powers. Its own means are adequate to its end; and on
those means it was expected to rely for their accomplishment. It would be
utterly absurd to make the powers of the constitution wholly dependent on state
institutions. But if state banks might be employed, as congress have a choice of
means, they had a right to choose a national bank, in preference to state banks,
for the financial operations of the government.
<a href="#029">

Proof, that they might use one means, is no proof, that they cannot
constitutionally use another means.

§ 1266.
</b>
After all, the subject has been
settled repeatedly by every department of the government, legislative,
executive, and judicial. The states have acquiesced; and a majority have
constantly sustained the power. If it is not now settled, it never can be. If it
is settled, it would be too much to expect a re-argument, whenever any person
may choose to question it.

<li><a id="023"></a>In Mr. Hamilton's celebrated Argument on the
  Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States, in Feb.1791, there is an
  admirable exposition of the whole of this branch of thesubject. As the
  document is rare, the following passages are inserted: 
  <p>"It is presumed to have been satisfactorily shown, inthe course of the preceding observations, 1. That the power of the government,as to the objects intrusted to its management, is, in its nature, sovereign 2.That the right of erecting corporations, is one, inherent in, and inseparablefrom, the idea of sovereign power. 3. That the position, that the government ofthe United States can exercise no power, but such as is delegated to it by itsconstitution, does not militate against this principle. 4. That the wordnecessary, in the general clause, can have norestrictiveoperation, derogating from the force of this principle; indeed, that the degree,in which a measure is, or is not necessary, cannot be a test ofconstitutionalright, but of expediency only. 5. That the power to erect corporations is not tobe considered, as an independent and substantive power, but as an incidental andauxiliary one; and was, therefore, more properly left to implication, thanexpressly granted. 6. That the principle in question does not extend the powerof the government beyond the prescribed limits, because it only affirms a powerto incorporate for purposeswithin the sphere of the specified powers.And lastly, that the right to exercise such a power, in certain cases, isunequivocally granted in the most positive and comprehensive terms. To all whichit only remains to be added, that such a power has actually been exercised intwo very eminent instances, namely, in the erection of two governments; onenorthwest of the river Ohio, and the other southwest; the last, independent ofany antecedent compact. And there results a full and complete demonstration,that the secretary of state and attorney-general are mistaken, when they denygenerally the power of the national government to erect corporations. </p>
  <p>"It shall now be endeavoured to be shown, that thereis a power to erect
  one of the kind proposed by the bill. This will be done bytracing a natural
  and obvious relation between the institution of a bank, andthe objects of
  several of the enumerated powers of the government; and byshowing,
  that,politicallyspeaking, it is necessary to the effectual execution of oneor
  more of those powers. In the course of this investigation various
  instanceswill be stated, by way of illustration, of a right to erect
  corporations underthose powers. Some preliminary observations may be proper.
  The proposed bank isto consist of an association of persons for the purpose
  of creating a jointcapital to be employed, chiefly and essentially, in loans.
  So far the object isnot only lawful, but it is the mere exercise of a right,
  which the law allows toevery individual. The bank of New-York, which is not
  incorporated, is an exampleof such an association. The bill proposes, in
  addition, that the governmentshall become a joint proprietor in this
  undertaking; and that it shall permitthe bills of the company, payable on
  demand, to be receivable in its revenues;and stipulates, that it shall not
  grant privileges, similar to those, which areto be allowed to this company,
  to any others. All this is incontrovertiblywithin the compass of the
  discretion of the government. The only question is,whether it has a right to
  incorporate this company, in order to enable it themore effectually to
  accomplish ends, which are in themselves lawful. Toestablish such a right, it
  remains to show the relation of such an institutionto one or more of the
  specified powers of the government. Accordingly, it isaffirmed, that it has a
  relation, more or less direct, to the power ofcollecting taxes; to that of
  borrowing money; to that of regulating tradebetween the states; and to those
  of raising and maintaining fleets and armies.To the two former, the relation
  may be said to be immediate. And, in the lastplace, it will be argued, that
  it is clearly within the provision, whichauthorizes the making of allneedful
  rulesandregulationsconcerning the property of the United States, as the
  samehas been practiced upon by the government.</p>
  <p>"A bank relates to the collection of taxes in twoways.Indirectly,by
  increasing the quantity of circulating medium, andquickening circulation,
  which facilitates the means of paying;directly,by creating aconvenient
  speciesof medium , in which they are to be paid. Todesignate or appoint the
  money or thing, in which taxes are to be paid, is notonly a proper, but a
  necessary,exerciseof the power of collectingthem. Accordingly, congress, in
  the law concerning the collection of the dutieson imposts and tonnage, have
  provided, that they shall be payable in gold andsilver. But while it was an
  indispensable part of the work to say in what theyshould be paid, the choice
  of the specific thing was mere matter of discretion.The payment might have
  been required in the commodities themselves. Taxes inkind, however
  ill-judged, are not without precedents even in the United states;or it might
  have been in the paper money of the several states, or in the billsof the
  bank of North-America, New-York, and Massachusetts, all or either ofthem; or
  it might have been in bills issued under the authority of the UnitedStates.
  No part of this can, it is presumed, be disputed. The appointment, then,of
  the money orthing,in which the taxes are to be paid, is an incidentto the
  power of collection. And among the expedients, which may be adopted, isthat
  of bills issued under the authority of the United States. Now the manner
  ofissuing these bills is again matter of discretion. The government
  might,doubtless, proceed in the following manner: It might provide that they
  should beissued under the direction of certain officers, payable on demand;
  and in orderto support their credit, and give them a ready circulation, it
  might, besidesgiving them a currency in its taxes, set apart, out of any
  monies in itstreasury a given sum, and appropriate it, under the direction of
  those officers,as a fund for answering the bills, as presented for
  payment.</p>
  <p>"The constitutionality of all this would not admit ofa question, and yet
  it would amount to the institution of a bank, with a view tothe more
  convenient collection of taxes. For the simplest and most precise ideaof a
  bank is, a deposit of coin or other property, as a fund forcirculatinga
  creditupon it, which is to answer the purpose of money. That such
  anarrangement would be equivalent to the establishment of a bank, would
  becomeobvious, if the place, where the fund to be set apart was kept, should
  be made areceptacle of the monies of all other persons, who should incline to
  depositthem there for safekeeping; and would become still more so, if the
  officers,charged with the direction of the fund were authorized to make
  discounts at theusual rate of interest, upon good security. To deny the power
  of the governmentto add this ingredient to the plan, would be to refine away
  all government. Afurther process will still more clearly illustrate the
  point. Suppose, when thespecies of bank, which has been described, was about
  to be instituted it were tobe urged, that in order to secure to it a due
  degree of confidence, the fundought not only to be set apart and appropriated
  generally, but ought to bespecifically vested in the officers, who were to
  have the direction of it, andin their successors in office, to the end, that
  it might acquire the characterofprivate property,incapable of being resumed
  without a violation ofthe sanction, by which the rights of property are
  protected; and occasioningmore serious and general alarm: the apprehension of
  which might operate as acheck upon the government. Such a proposition might
  be opposed by argumentsagainst the expediency of it, or the solidity of the
  reason assigned for it; butit is not conceivable, what could be urged against
  its constitutionality. Andyet such a disposition of the thing would amount to
  the erection of acorporation; for the true definition of a corporation seems
  to be this: It is alegalperson, or a person created by act of law; consisting
  of one ormore natural persons, authorized to hold property or a franchise in
  succession,in a legal, as contradistinguished from a natural capacity. Let
  the illustrationproceed a step further. Suppose a bank, of the nature, which
  has been described,without or with incorporation, had been instituted, and
  that experience hadevinced, as it probably would, that being wholly under a
  public direction, itpossessed not the confidence requisite to the credit of
  its bills. Suppose also,that by some of those adverse conjunctures, which
  occasionally attend nations,there had been a very great drain of the specie
  of the country, so as not onlyto cause general distress for want of an
  adequate medium of circulation; but toproduce, in consequence of that
  circumstance, considerable defalcations in thepublic revenues. Suppose, also,
  that there was no bank instituted in any state;in such a posture of things,
  would it not be most manifest, that theincorporation of a bank, like that
  proposed by the bill, would be a measureimmediately relative to the effectual
  collection of the taxes, and completelywithin the province of a sovereign
  power of providing, by all laws necessary andproper, for that collection.</p>
  <p>"If it be said, that such a state of things wouldrender that necessary,
  and therefore constitutional, which is not so now; theanswer to this, (and a
  solid one it doubtless is,) must still be, that which hasbeen already stated;
  circumstances may affect theexpediencyof themeasure, but they can neither add
  to, nor diminish itsconstitutionality.A bank has a direct relation to the
  power of borrowing money, because it is anusual, and in sudden emergencies,
  an essential instrument, in the obtaining ofloans to government. A nation is
  threatened with a war; large sums are wanted ona sudden to make the requisite
  preparations; taxes are laid for the purpose; butit requires time to obtain
  the benefit of them; anticipation is indispensable.If there be a bank, the
  supply can at once be had; if there be none, loans fromindividuals must be
  sought. The progress of these is often too slow for theexigency; in some
  situations they are not practicable at all. Frequently whenthey are, it is of
  great consequence to be able to anticipate the product ofthem by advances
  from a bank. The essentiality of such an institution, as aninstrument of
  loans, is exemplified at this very moment. An Indian expedition isto be
  prosecuted. The only fund, out of which the money can arise consistentlywith
  the public engagements, is a tax, which only begins to be collected in
  Julynext. The preparations, however, are instantly to be made. The money
  must,therefore, be borrowed; and of whom could it be borrowed, if there were
  nopublic banks? It happens, that there are institutions of this kind; but if
  therewere none, it would be indispensable to create one. Let it then be
  supposed,that the necessity existed, (as but for a casualty would be the
  case,) thatproposals were made for obtaining a loan; that a number of
  individuals cameforward and said, we are willing to accommodate the
  government with this money;with what we have in hand, and the credit we can
  raise upon it, we doubt not ofbeing able to furnish the sum required. But in
  order to this, it isindispensable, that we should be incorporated as a bank.
  This is essentialtowards putting it in our power to do what is desired, and
  we are obliged, onthat account, to make it theconsiderationorconditionof
  theloan. Can it be believed, that a compliance with this proposition would
  beunconstitutional? Does not this alone evince the contrary? It is a
  necessarypart of a power to borrow, to be able to stipulate the
  considerations orconditions of a loan. It is evident, as has been remarked
  elsewhere, that thisis not confined to the mere stipulation of a franchise.
  If it may, (and it isnot perceived why it may not,) then the grant of a
  corporate capacity may bestipulated, as a consideration of the loan. There
  seems to be nothing unfit, orforeign from the nature of the thing, in giving
  individuality, or a corporatecapacity, to a number of persons, who are
  willing to lend a sum of money to thegovernment, the better to enable them to
  do it, and make them an ordinaryinstrument of loans in future emergencies of
  state.</p>
  <p>"But the more general view of the subject is stillmore satisfactory. The
  legislative power of borrowing money, and of making alllaws necessary and
  proper for carrying into execution that power, seemsobviously competent to
  the appointment of theorgan,through which theabilities and wills of
  individuals may be most efficaciously exerted, for theaccommodation of the
  government by loans. The attorney-general opposes to thisreasoning the
  following observation. Borrowing money presupposes theaccumulation of a fund
  to be lent; and is secondary to the creation of anability to lend. This is
  plausible in theory, but it is not true in fact. In agreat number of cases, a
  previous accumulation of a fund, equal to the whole sumrequired, does not
  exist; and nothing more can be actually presupposed, thanthat there exists
  resources, which, put into activity to the greatest advantage,by the nature
  of the operation with the government, will be equal to the effectdesired to
  be produced. All the provisions and operations of government must bepresumed
  to contemplate things as theyreallyare. The institution of abank has also a
  natural relation to the regulation of trade between the states,in so far as
  it is conducive to the creation of a convenient medium of exchangebetween
  them, and to the keeping up a full circulation, by preventing thefrequent
  displacement of the metals in reciprocal remittances. Money is the veryhinge
  on which commerce turns. And this does not mean merely gold and silver;many
  other things have served the purpose with different degrees of utility.Paper
  has been extensively employed. It cannot, therefore, be admitted with
  theattorney-general, that the regulation of trade between the states, as
  itconcerns the medium of circulation and exchange, ought to be considered
  asconfined to coin. It is even supposable, that the whole, or the greatest
  part,of the coin of the country, might be carried out of it. The secretary of
  stateobjects to the relation here insisted upon, by the following mode of
  reasoning:To erect a bank, says he, and to regulate commerce, are very
  different acts. Hewho erects a bank, creates a subject of commerce. So does
  he, who raises abushel of wheat, or digs a dollar out of the mines; yet
  neither of these personsregulates commerce thereby. To make a thing, which
  may be bought and sold, isnot to prescribe regulations
  forbuyingandselling.This ismaking the regulation of commerce to consist in
  prescribing rules for buying andselling. This, indeed, is a species of
  regulation of trade, but it is one, whichfalls more aptly within the province
  of the local jurisdictions, than withinthat of the general government, whose
  care they must have presumed to have beenintended to be directed to those
  general political arrangement concerning trade,on which its aggregate
  interests depend, rather than to the details of buyingand selling.
  Accordingly, such only are the regulations to be found in the lawsof the
  United States; whose objects are to give encouragement to the enterpriseof
  our own merchants, and to advance our navigation and manufactures. And it
  isin reference to these general relations of commerce, that an
  establishment,which furnishes facilities to circulation, and a convenient
  medium of exchangeand alienation, is to be regarded as a regulation of trade.
  </p>
  <p>"The secretary of state further urges, that if thiswas a regulation of
  commerce, it would bevoid,asextendingasmuch to the internal part of every
  state, as to its external. But whatregulation of commerce does not extend to
  the internal commerce of every state?What are all the duties upon imported
  articles, amounting, in some cases, toprohibitions, but so many bounties upon
  domestic manufactures, affecting theinterest of different classes of citizens
  in different ways? What are all theprovisions in the coasting act, which
  relate to the trade between district anddistrict of the same state? In short,
  what regulation of trade between thestates, but must affect the internal
  trade of each state? What can operate uponthe whole, but must extend to every
  part? The relation of a bank to theexecution of the powers, that concern the
  common defence, has been anticipated.It has been noted, that at this very
  moment, the aid of such an institution isessential to the measure to be
  pursued for the protection of our frontiers. </p>
  <p>"It now remains to show, that the incorporation of abank is within the
  operation of the provision, which authorizes congress to makeall needful
  rules and regulations concerning the property of the United States.But it is
  previously necessary to advert to a distinction, which has been takenup by
  the attorney-general. He admits, that the word property may signifypersonal
  property, however acquired; and yet asserts, that it cannot signifymoney
  arising from the sources of revenue pointed out in the
  constitution,'because,' says he, 'the disposal and regulation of money is the
  final cause forraising it by taxes.' But it would be more accurate, to say,
  that theobjectto which money is intended to be applied, is thefinal causefor
  raisingit, than that the disposal and regulation of it, is such. The support
  of agovernment, the support of troops for the common defence, the payment of
  thepublic debt, are the true final causes for raising money. The disposition
  andregulation of it, when raised. are the steps, by which it is applied to
  theends,for which it was raised, not the ends themselves. Hence, therefore
  the money tobe raised by taxes, as well as any other personal property, must
  be supposed tocome within the meaning, as they certainly do within the
  letter, of authority tomake all needful rules and regulations concerning the
  property of the UnitedStates. A case will make this plainer. Suppose the
  public debt discharged, andthe funds now pledged for it, liberated. In some
  instances it would be foundexpedient to repeal the taxes; in others, the
  repeal might injure our ownindustry, our agriculture, and manufactures. In
  these cases, they would, ofcourse, be retained. Here, then, would be monies
  arising from the authorizedsources of revenue, which would not fall within
  the rule, by which theattorney-general endeavours to except them from other
  personal property, andfrom the operation of the clause in question. The
  monies being in the coffers ofgovernment, what is to hinder such a
  disposition to be made of them, as iscontemplated in the bill; or what an
  incorporation of the parties concerned,under the clause, which has been
  cited. </p>
  <p>"It is admitted, that, with regard to the westernterritory, they give a
  power to erect a corporation; that is, to constitute agovernment. And by what
  rule of construction can it be maintained, that the samewords, in a
  constitution of government, will not have the same effect, whenapplied to one
  species of property as to another, as far as the subject iscapable of it? Or
  that a legislative power to make all needful rules andregulations, or to pass
  all laws necessary and proper concerning the publicproperty, which is
  admitted to authorize an incorporation, in one case, will notauthorize it in
  another? Will justify the institution of a government over theWestern
  Territory, and will not justify the incorporation of a bank, for themore
  useful management of the money of the nation? If it will do the last aswell
  as the first, then, under this provision alone, the bill is
  constitutional,because it contemplates, that the United States shall be joint
  proprietors ofthe stock of the bank. There is an observation of the secretary
  of state, tothis effect, which may require notice in this place. — Congress,
  says he,are not to lay taxesad libitum, for any purpose they please,but
  onlyto pay the debts, or provide for the welfare of the Union. Certainly,
  noinference can be drawn from this, against the power of applying their money
  forthe institution of a bank. It is true, that they cannot, without breach
  oftrust, lay taxes for any other purpose, than the general welfare; but so
  neithercan any other government. The welfare of the community is the only
  legitimateend, for which money can be raised on the community. Congress can
  be consideredas only under one restriction, which does not apply to other
  governments. Theycannot rightfully apply the money they raise to any purpose,
  merely or purelylocal, But with this exception, they have as large a
  discretion, in relation tothe application of money, as any legislature
  whatever. </p>
  <p>"The constitutionaltestof a rightapplication, must always be, whether it
  be for a purpose ofgeneralorlocalnature. If the former, there can be no want
  of constitutionalpower. The quality of the object as how far it will really
  promote, or not, thewelfare of the Union, must be matter of conscientious
  discretion; and thearguments for or against a measure, in this light, must be
  arguments concerningexpediency or inexpediency, not constitutional right;
  whatever relates to thegeneral order of the finances, to the general
  interests of trade, &c., beinggeneral objects, are constitutional ones, for
  theapplication of money.A bank, then, whose bills are to circulate in all the
  revenues of the country,is evidently a general object; and for that very
  reason, a constitutional one,as far as regards the appropriation of money to
  it, whether it will really be abeneficial one or not, is worthy of careful
  examination; but is no more aconstitutional point, in the particular referred
  to, than the question, whetherthe western lands shall be sold for twenty or
  thirty cents per acre? A hope isentertained, that, by this time, it has been
  made to appear to the satisfactionof the President, that the bank has a
  natural relation to the power ofcollecting taxes; to that of regulating
  trade; to that of providing for thecommon defence; and that, as the bill
  under consideration contemplates thegovernment in the light of a joint
  proprietor of the stock of the bank, itbrings the case within the provision
  of the clause of the constitution, whichimmediately respects the property of
  the United States. Under a conviction, thatsuch a relation subsists, the
  secretary of the treasury, with all deference,conceives, that it will result,
  as a necessary consequence from the position,that all the specified powers of
  government are sovereign, as to the properobjects, that the incorporation of
  a bank is a constitutional measure: and thatthe objections, taken to the bill
  in this respect, are ill-founded. </p>
  <p>"But, from an earnest desire to give the utmostpossible satisfaction to
  the mind of the president, on so delicate and importanta subject, the
  secretary of the treasury will ask his indulgence, while he givessome
  additional illustrations of cases, in which a power of erectingcorporations
  may be exercised, under some of those heads of the specified powersof the
  government, which are alleged to include the right of incorporating abank. 1.
  It does not appear susceptible of a doubt, that if congress had thoughtproper
  to provide in the collection law, that the bonds, to be given for theduties,
  should be given to the collector of the district A. or B. as the casemight
  require, to inure to him and his successors in office, in trust for theUnited
  States; that it would have been consistent with the constitution to makesuch
  an arrangement. And yet this, it is conceived, would amount to
  anincorporation. 2. It is not an unusual expedient of taxation, to farm
  particularbranches of revenue; that is, to sell or mortgage the product of
  them forcertain definite sums, leaving the collection to the parties, to whom
  they aremortgaged or sold. There are even examples of this in the United
  States. Supposethat there was any particular branch of revenue, which it was
  manifestlyexpedient to place on this footing, and there were a number of
  persons willingto engage with the government, upon condition that they should
  be incorporated,and the funds vested in them, as well for their greater
  safety, as for the moreconvenient recovery and management of the taxes; is it
  supposable that therecould be any constitutional obstacle to the measure? It
  is presumed, that therecould be none. It is certainly a mode of collection,
  which it would be in thediscretion of the government to adopt; though the
  circumstances must be veryextraordinary, that would induce the secretary to
  think it expedient. 3. Supposea new and unexplored branch of trade should
  present itself with some foreigncountry. Suppose it was manifest, that to
  undertake it with advantage, requireda union of the capitals of a number of
  individuals, and that those individualswould not be disposed to embark
  without an incorporation, as well to obviate theconsequences of a private
  partnership, which makes every individual liable inhis whole estate for the
  debts of the company to their utmost extent, as for themore convenient
  management of the business; what reason can there be to doubt,that the
  national government would have a constitutional right to institute
  andincorporate such a company? None. They possess a general authority to
  regulatetrade with foreign countries. This is a mean, which has been
  practiced to thatend by all the principal commercial nations, who have
  trading companies to thisday, which have subsisted for centuries. Why may not
  the United Statesconstitutionallyemploy the means usual in other countries
  for attaining the ends intrusted tothem? A power to make all needful rules
  and regulations concerning territory,has been construed to mean a power to
  erect a government. A power to regulatetrade is a power to make all needful
  rules and regulations concerning trade. Whymay it not, then, include that of
  erecting a trading company, as well as inother cases to erect a government?
  </p>
  <p>"It is remarkable, that the state conventions, whohave proposed amendments
  in relation to this point, have most, if not all ofthem, ex pressed
  themselves nearly thus: Congress shall not grant monopolies,norerect any
  companywith exclusive advantages of commerce! Thus at thesame time expressing
  their sense, that the power to erect trading companies, orcorporations, was
  inherent in congress, and objecting to it no further, than asto the grant
  ofexclusiveprivileges. The secretary entertains all thedoubts, which prevail
  concerning the utility of such companies; but he cannotfashion to his own
  mind a reason to induce a doubt, that there is aconstitutional authority in
  the United States to establish them. If such areason were demanded, none
  could be given, unless it were this — thatcongress cannot erect a
  corporation; which would be no better, than to say, theycannot do it, because
  they cannot do it. First, presuming an inability withoutreason, and then
  assigning that inability, as the cause of itself. Illustrationsof this kind
  might be multiplied without end. They will, however, be pursued nofurther.
  </p>
  <p>"There is a sort of evidence on this point, arisingfrom an aggregate view
  of the constitution, which is of no inconsiderableweight. The very general
  power of laying and collecting taxes, and appropriatingtheir proceeds; that
  of borrowing money indefinitely; that of coining money andregulating foreign
  coins; that of making all needful rules and regulationsrespecting the
  property of the United States; — these powers combined, aswell as the reason
  and nature of the thing, speak strongly this language; thatit is the manifest
  design and scope of the constitution to vest in congress allthe powers
  requisite to the effectual administration of the finances of theUnited
  States. As far as concerns this object, there appears to be no parsimonyof
  power. To suppose, then, that the government is precluded from the
  employmentof so usual, and so important an instrument for the administration
  of itsfinances, as that of a bank, is to suppose, what does not coincide with
  thegeneral tenour and complexion of the constitution, and what is not
  agreeable toimpressions, that any mere spectator would entertain concerning
  it. Little less,than a prohibitory clause, can destroy the strong
  presumptions, which resultfrom the general aspect of the government. Nothing
  but demonstration shouldexclude the idea, that the power exists. </p>
  <p>"In all questions of this nature, the practice ofmankind ought to have
  great weight against the theories of individuals. Thefact, for instance, that
  all the principal commercial nations have made use oftrading corporations or
  companies, for the purpose ofexternal commerce,is a satisfactory proof, that
  the establishment of them is an incident to theregulation of commerce. This
  other fact, that banks are an usual engine in theadministration of national
  finances, and an ordinary, and the most effectualinstrument of loans, and
  one, which, in this country, has been found essential,pleads strongly against
  the supposition, that a government clothed with most ofthe important
  prerogatives of sovereignty, in relation to its revenues, itsdebt, its
  credit, its defence, its trade, its intercourse with foreign nations,is
  forbidden to make use of that instrument, as an appendage to its
  ownauthority. It has been usual, as an auxiliary test of constitutional
  authority,to try, whether it abridges any pre-existing right of my state, or
  anyindividual. The proposed measure will stand the most severe examination on
  thispoint. Each state may still erect as many banks, as it pleases; every
  individualmay still carry on the banking business to any extent he pleases.
  Anothercriterion may be this; whether the institution or thing has a more
  directrelation, as to its uses, to the objects of the reserved powers of the
  stategovernment, than to those of the powers delegated by the United States?
  Thisrule, indeed, is less precise, than the former; but it may still serve as
  someguide. Surely, a bank has more reference to the objects, intrusted to
  thenational government, than to those left to the care of the state
  governments.The common defence is decisive in this comparison.</p>
