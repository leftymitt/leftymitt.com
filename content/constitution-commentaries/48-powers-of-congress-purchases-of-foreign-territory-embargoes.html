the
most remarkable powers, which have been exercised by the government, as
auxiliary and implied powers, and which, if any, go to the utmost verge of
liberal construction, are the laying of an unlimited embargo in 1807, and
the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, and its subsequent admission into the
Union, as a state. These measures were brought forward, and supported, and
carried, by the known and avowed friends of a strict construction of the
constitution; and they were justified at the time, and can be now
justified, only upon the doctrines of those, who support a liberal
construction of the constitution. The subject has been already hinted at;
but it deserves a more deliberate review.

§ 1278.
</b>
In regard to the acquisition of
Louisiana: The treaty of 1803 contains a cession of the whole of that vast
territory by France to the United States, for a sum exceeding eleven
millions of dollars. There is a stipulation in the treaty on the part of
the United States, that the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be
incorporated into the Union, and admitted, as soon as possible, according
to the principles of the federal constitution, to the enjoyment of all the
rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States.

§ 1279.
</b>
It is obvious, that the treaty
embraced several very important questions, each of them upon the grounds
of a strict construction full of difficulty and delicacy. In the first
place, had the United States a constitutional authority to accept the
cession and pay for it? In the next place, if they had, was the
stipulation for the admission of the inhabitants into the Union, as a
state, constitutional, or within the power of congress to give it effect?

§ 1280.
</b>
There is no pretence, that the
purchase, or cession of any foreign territory is within any of the powers
expressly enumerated in the constitution. It is no where in that
instrument said, that congress, or any other department of the national
government, shall have a right to purchase, or accept of any cession of
foreign territory. The power itself (it has been said) could scarcely have
been in the contemplation of the framers of it. It is, in its own nature, 
as dangerous to liberty, as susceptible of abuse in its actual
application, and as likely as any, which could be imagined, to lead to a
dissolution of the Union. If congress have the power, it may unite any
foreign territory whatsoever to our own, however distant, however
populous, and however powerful. Under the form of a cession, we may become
united to a more powerful neighbour or rival; and be involved in European,
or other foreign interests, and contests, to an interminable extent. And
if there may be a stipulation for the admission of foreign states into the
Union, the whole balance of the constitution may be destroyed, and the old
states sunk into utter insignificance. It is incredible, that it should
have been contemplated, that any such overwhelming authority should be
confided to the national government with the consent of the people of the
old states. If it exists at all, it is unforeseen, and the result of a 
sovereignty, intended to be limited, and yet not sufficiently guarded. The
very case of the cession of Louisiana is a striking illustration of the
doctrine. It admits, by consequence, into the Union an immense territory,
equal to, if not greater, than that of all the United States under the
peace of 1783. In the natural progress of events, it must, within a short
period, change the whole balance of power in the Union, and transfer to
the West all the important attributes of the sovereignty of the whole. If,
as is well known, one of the strong objections urged against the
constitution was, that the original territory of the United States was too
large for a national government; it is inconceivable, that it could have
been within the intention of the people, that any additions of foreign
territory should be made, which should thus double every danger from this
source. The treaty-making power must be construed, as confined to objects
within the scope of the constitution. And, although congress have
authority to admit new states into the firm, yet it is demonstrable, that
this clause had sole reference to the territory then belonging to the
United States; and was designed for the admission of the states, which,
under the ordinance of 1787, were contemplated to be formed within its old
boundaries. In regard to the appropriation of money for the purposes of
the cession the case is still stronger. If no appropriation of money can
be made, except for cases within the enumerated powers, (and this clearly
is not one,) how can the enormous sum of eleven millions be justified for
this object? If it be said, that it will be "for the common defence,
and general welfare" to purchase the territory, how is this
reconcileable with the strict construction of the constitution? If
congress can appropriate money for one object, because it is deemed for
the common defence and general welfare, why may they not appropriate it
for all objects of the same sort? If the territory can be purchased, it
must be governed; and a territorial government must be created. But where
can congress find authority in the constitution to erect a territorial 
government, since it does not possess the power to erect corporations?

<b>
§ 1281.
</b>
Such were the objections, which
have been, and in fact may be, urged against the cession, and the
appropriations made to carry the treaty into effect. The friends of the
measure were driven to the adoption of the doctrine, that the right to
acquire territory was incident to national sovereignty; that it was a
resulting power, growing necessarily out of the aggregate powers confided
by the federal constitution; that the appropriation might justly be
vindicated upon this ground, and also upon the ground, that it was for the
common defence and general welfare. In short, there is no possibility of
defending the constitutionality of this measure, but upon the principles
of the liberal construction, which has been, upon other occasions, so
earnestly resisted.

§ 1282.
</b>
As an incidental power, the
constitutional right of the United States to acquire territory would seem
so naturally to flow from the sovereignty confided to it, as not to admit
of very serious question. The constitution confers on the government of
the Union the power of making war, and of making treaties; and it seems
consequently to possess the power of acquiring territory either by
conquest of treaty.
<a href="#003">

<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
If the
cession be by treaty, the terms of that treaty must be obligatory; for it
is the law of the land. And if it stipulates for the enjoyment by the
inhabitants of the rights, privileges, and immunities of citizens of the
United States, and for the admission of the territory into the Union, as a
state, these stipulations must be equally obligatory. They are within the
scope of the constitutional authority of the government, which has the
right to acquire territory, to make treaties, and to admit new states into
the Union.

§ 1283.
</b>
The mere recent acquisition of
Florida, which has been universally approved, or acquiesced in by all the
states, can be maintained only on the same principles; and furnishes a
striking illustration of the truth, that constitutions of government
require a liberal construction to effect their objects, and that a narrow
interpretation of their powers, however it may suit the views of
speculative philosophers, or the accidental interests of political
parties, is incompatible with the permanent interests of the state, and
subversive of the great ends of all government, the safety and
independence of the people.

<b>
§ 1284.
</b>
The other instance of an
extraordinary application of the implied powers of the government, above
alluded to, is the embargo laid in the year 1807, by the special
recommendation of President Jefferson. It was avowedly recommended, as a
measure of safety for our vessels, our seamen, and our merchandise from
the then threatening dangers from the belligerents of Europe;
<a href="#005">
<b>
<sup>
5
</sup>
</b>
</a>
and it was explicitly stated "to
be a measure of precaution called for by the occasion;" and "neither
hostile in its character, nor as justifying, or inciting, or leading to
hostility with any nation whatever."
<a href="#006">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
It was in no sense, then, a war measure. If it could be classed at all, as
flowing from, or as an incident to, any of the enumerated powers, it was
that of regulating commerce. In its terms, the act provided, that an
embargo be, and hereby is, laid on all ships and vessels in the ports, or
within the limits or jurisdiction, of the United States, &amp;c. bound to
any foreign port or place.
<a href="#007">

</a>
It
was in its terms unlimited in duration; and could be removed only by a
subsequent act of congress, having the assent of all the constitutional
branches of the legislature.

<b>
§ 1285.
</b>
No one can reasonably doubt,
that the laying of an embargo, suspending commerce for a limited period,
is within the scope of the constitution. But the question of difficulty
was, whether congress, under the power to regulate commerce with foreign
nations, could constitutionally suspend and interdict it wholly for an
unlimited period, that is, by a permanent act, having no limitation as to
duration, either of the act, or of the embargo. It was most seriously
controverted, and its constitutionality denied in the Eastern states of
the Union, during its existence. An appeal was made to the judiciary upon
the question; and it having been settled to be constitutional by that
department of the government, the decision was acquiesced in, though the
measure bore with almost unexampled severity, upon the Eastern states; and
its ruinous effects can still be traced along their extensive seaboard.
The argument was, that the power to regulate did not include the power to
annihilate commerce, by interdicting it permanently and entirely with
foreign nations. The decision was, that the power of congress was
sovereign, relative to commercial intercourse, qualified by the
limitations and restrictions contained in the constitution itself.
Non-intercourse and Embargo laws are within the range of legislative
discretion; and if congress have the power, for purposes of safety, of
preparation, or counteraction, to suspend commercial intercourse with
foreign nations, they are not limited, as to the duration, any more, than
as to the manner and extent of the measure.

§ 1286.
</b>
That this measure went to the
utmost verge of constitutional power, and especially of implied power, has
never been denied. That it could not be justified by any, but the most
liberal construction of the constitution, is equally undeniable. It was
the favourite measure of those, who were generally the advocates of the
strictest construction. It was sustained by the people from a belief, that
it was promotive of the interests, and important to the safety of the 
Union.

<b>
§ 1287.
</b>
At the present day, few
statesmen are to be found, who seriously contest the constitutionality of
the acts respecting either the embargo, or the purchase and admission of
Louisiana into the Union. The general voice of the nation has sustained,
and supported them. Why, then, should not that general voice be equally
respected in relation to other measures of vast public importance, and by
many deemed of still more vital interest to the country, such as the
tariff laws, and the national bank charter? Can any measures furnish a
more instructive lesson, or a more salutary admonition, in the whole
history of parties, at once to moderate our zeal, and awaken our
vigilance, than those, which stand upon principles repudiated at one time
upon constitutional scruples, and solemnly adopted at another time, to
subserve a present good, or foster the particular policy of an
administration? While the principles of the constitution should be
preserved with a most guarded caution, and a most sacred regard to the
rights of the states; it is at once the dictate of wisdom, and enlightened
patriotism to avoid that narrowness of interpretation, which would dry up
all its vital powers, or compel the government (as was done under the
confederation,) to break down all constitutional barriers, and trust for
its vindication to the people, upon the dangerous political maxim, that
the safety of the people is the supreme law, (
<i>
salus populi suprema lex
</i>
;)
a maxim, which might be used to justify the appointment of a dictator, or
any other usurpation.

§ 1288.
</b>
There remain one or two other
measures of a political nature, whose constitutionality has been denied;
but which, being of a transient character, have left no permanent traces
in the constitutional jurisprudence of the country. Reference is here made
to the Alien and Sedition laws, passed in 1798, both of which were limited
to a short duration, and expired by their own limitation.
<a href="#011">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
One (the Alien act) authorized the president to order out of the country
such aliens, as he should deem dangerous to the peace and safety of the
United States; or should have reasonable grounds to suspect to be
concerned in any treasonable, or secret machinations against the
government of the United States, under severe penalties for disobedience.
The other declared it a public crime, punishable with fine and
imprisonment, for any persons unlawfully to combine, and conspire
together, with intent to oppose any measure or measures of the United
States, &amp;c.; or with such intent, to counsel, advise, or attempt to
procure any insurrection, unlawful assembly, or combination; or to write,
print, utter, or publish, or cause, or procure to be written, &amp;c., or
willingly to assist in writing, &amp;c., any false, scandalous, and
malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States,
or either house of congress, or the president, with intent to defame them,
or to bring them into contempt, or disrepute, or to excite against them
the hatred of the people, or to stir up sedition; or to excite any
unlawful combination for opposing, or resisting any law, or any lawful act
of the president, or to resist, oppose, or defeat any such law or act; or 
to aid, encourage, or abet any hostile designs of any foreign nations
against the United States. It provided, however, that the truth of the
writing or libel might be given in evidence; and that the jury, who tried
the cause, should have a right to determine the law and the fact, under
the direction of the court, as in other cases.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1289">
</a>
<b>
§ 1289.
</b>
The constitutionality of both
the acts was assailed with great earnestness and ability at the time; and
was defended with equal masculine vigour. The ground of the advocates, in
favour of these laws, was, that they resulted from the right and duty in
the government of self-preservation, and the like duty and protection of
its functionaries in the proper discharge of their official duties. They
were impugned, as not conformable to the letter or spirit of the
constitution; and as inconsistent in their principles with the rights of
citizens, and the liberty of the press. The Alien act was denounced, as
exercising a power not delegated by the constitution; as uniting
legislative and judicial functions, with that of the executive; and by
this Union as subverting the general principles of free government, and
the particular organization and positive provisions of the constitution.
It was added, that the Sedition act was open to the same objection, and
was expressly forbidden by one of the amendments of the constitution, on
which there will be occasion hereafter to comment.

<sup>

</b>
</a>
At present it does not seem necessary to present more than this general
outline, as the measures are not likely to be renewed; and as the
doctrines, on which they are maintained, and denounced, are not materially
different from those, which have been already considered.

<li><a id="002"></a>See the Debates in 1803, on theLouisiana Treaty, printed by T. & G. Palmer in Philadelphia, in 1804,and 4 Elliot's Debates 257 to 260. -- The objections were not taken merelyby persons, who were at that time in opposition to the nationaladministration. President Jefferson himself (under whose auspices thetreaty was made,) was of opinion, that the measure was unconstitutional,and required an amendment of the constitution to justify it. Heaccordingly urged his friends strenuously to that course; at the same timehe added, "that it will be desirable for congress to do what isnecessary insilence"; "whatever congress shall thinknecessary to do should be done with aslittle debate as possible, andparticularly so far as respects the constitutional difficulty." "Iconfess, then, I think it important in the present case, to set an exampleagainst broad construction by appealing for new power to the people. If,however, our friends shall think differently, certainly I shall acquiescewith satisfaction; confiding, that the good sense of our country willcorrect the evil of construction, when it shall produce ill effects."What a latitude of interpretation is this! The constitution may beover-leaped, and abroadconstruction adopted for favouritemeasures, and resistance is to be made to such a construction only, whenit shall produce ill effects! His letter to Dr. Sibley (in June, 1803}recently published is decisive, that he thought an amendment of theconstitution necessary. Yet he did not hesitate without such amendment togive effect to every measure to carry the treaty into effect during hisadministration. See 4 Jefferson's Corresp. p.

<li><a id="012"></a>The Alien, and Sedition Actswere the immediate cause of the Virginia Resolutions of December, 1798,and of the elaborate vindication of them, in the celebrated Report of the7th of January, 1800. The learned reader will there find an ampleexposition of the whole constitutional objections. See also 4 Jefferson'sCorrespondence, 93, 27. The reasoning on the other side may be found inthe Debates in Congress, at the time of the passage of these acts. It isgreatly to be lamented, that there is no authentic collection of all theDebates in congress, in a form, like that of the Parliamentary Debates.See also 4 Elliot's Deb. 251, 252; Debates on the Judiciary, in 1802, Mr.Bayard's Speech, p. 371, 372; Addison's Charges to the Grand Jury, No. 25,p. 270; Id.

<li><a id="013"></a>Mr. Vice President Calhoun, inhis letter of the 28th of August, 1832, to Gov. Hamilton, uses thefollowing language. "From the adoption of the constitution we havehad but one continued agitation of constitutional questions, embracingsome of the most important powers exercised by the government; and yet, inspite of all the ability, and force of argument, displayed in the variousdiscussions, backed by the high authority, claimed for the Supreme Courtto adjust such controversies, not a single constitutional question of apolitical character, which has ever been agitated during this long period,has been settled in the public opinion,except that of theunconstitutionality of the Alien, and Sedition laws; and what isremarkable, that was settledagainst the decision of the Supreme Court."Now, in the first place, the constitutionality of the Alien, and Seditionlaws never came before the Supreme Court for decision; and consequently,never was decided by that court. In the next place, what is meant bypublicopiniondeciding constitutional questions? What public opinion? Where,and at what time delivered? It is notorious, that some of the ableststatesmen and jurists of America, at the time of the passage of theseacts, and ever since, have maintained the constitutionality of these laws.They were upheld, as constitutional, by some of the most intelligent, andable state legislatures in the Union, in deliberate resolutions affirmingtheir constitutionality. Nay more, it may be affirmed, that at the time,when the controversy engaged the public mind most earnestly upon thesubject, there was, (to say the least of it) as great a weight ofjudicial, and professional talent, learning, and patriotism, enlisted intheir favour, as there ever has been against them. If, by being settled bypublic opinion, is meant that all the people of America were united in oneopinion on the subject, the correctness of the statement cannot beadmitted; though its sincerity will not be questioned. It is one thing tobelieve a doctrine universally admitted, because we ourselves think itclear; and quite another thing to establish the fact. The Sedition andAlien laws were generally deemed inexpedient, and therefore any allusionto them now rarely occurs, except in political discussions, when they areintroduced to add odium to the party, by which they were adopted. But themost serious doubts may be entertained, whether even in the present day, amajority of constitutional lawyers, or of judicial opinions, deliberatelyhold them to be unconstitutional. If public opinion is to decide constitutionalquestions, instead of the public functionaries of the government in theirdeliberate discussions and judgments, (a course quite novel in the annalsof jurisprudence,) it would be desirable to have some mode of ascertainingit in a satisfactory, and conclusive form; and some uniform test of it,independent of mere private conjectures. No such mode has, as yet, beenprovided in the constitution. And, perhaps, it will be found upon dueinquiry, that different opinions prevail at the same time on the samesubject, in the North, the South, the East, and the West. If the judgmentsof the Supreme Court (as it is more than hinted) have not, even upon themost deliberatejuridicalarguments, been satisfactory, can it beexpected thatpopulararguments will be more so? It is said, thatnot a single constitutional question, except that of the Alien andSedition laws, has ever been settled. If by this no more is meant, thanthat all minds have not acquiesced in the decisions, the statement must beadmitted to be correct. And such must, under such a postulate, be for everthe case with all constitutional questions. It is utterly hopeless in anyway to satisfy all minds upon such a subject. But if it be meant, thatthese decisions have not been approved, or acquiesced in, by a majority ofthe Union, as correct expositions of the constitution, that is astatement, which remains to be proved; and is certainly not to be takenfor granted. In truth, it is obvious, that so long as statesmen deny, thatany decision of the Supreme Court is conclusive upon the interpretation ofthe constitution, it is wholly impossible, that any constitutionalquestion should ever, in their view, be settled. It may always becontroverted; and if so, it will always be controverted by some persons.Human nature never yet presented the extraordinary spectacle of all minds,agreeing in all things; nay not in all truths, moral, political, civil, orreligious. Will the case be better, when twenty-four different states areto settle such questions, as they may please, from day to day, or year toyear; holding one opinion at one time, and another at another? Ifconstitutional questions are never to be deemed settled, while any personsshall be found to avow a doubt, what is to become of any government,national or state? Did any statesmen ever conceive the project of aconstitution of government for a nation or state, every one of whosepowers and operations should be liable to be suspended at the will of anyone, who should doubt their constitutionality? Is a constitution ofgovernment made only, as a text, about which, casuistry and ingenuity mayframe endless doubts, and endless questions? Or is it made, as a fixedsystem to guide, to cheer, to support, and to protect the people? Is thereany gain to rational liberty, by perpetuating doctrines, which leaveobedience an affair of mere choice or speculation, now and for ever?</li>
