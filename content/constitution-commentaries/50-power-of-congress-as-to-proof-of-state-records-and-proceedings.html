first section of the fourth article declares: "Full faith and credit
shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial
proceedings of every other state. And the congress may by general laws
prescribe the manner, in which such acts, records, and proceeding shall be
proved, and
<i>
the effect thereof
</i>
."

§ 1298.

The articles of confederation
contained a provision on the same subject. It was, that "full faith
and credit shall be given in each of these states to the records, acts,
and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other
state."

It has
been said, that the meaning of this clause is extremely indeterminate; and
that it was of but little importance under any interpretation, which it
would bear.

The latter
remark may admit of much question, and is certainly quite too loose and
general in its texture. But there can be no difficulty in affirming, that
the authority given to congress, under the constitution, to prescribe the
form and effect of the proof is a valuable improvement, and confers
additional certainty, as to the true nature and import of the clause. The
clause, as reported in the first draft of the constitution, was, "that
full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the
</p>


<i>
acts of the
legislature
</i>
, and to the records and judicial proceedings of the courts
and magistrates of every other state." The amendment was subsequently
reported, substantially in the form, in which it now stands, except that
the words, in the introductory clause, were, "Full faith and credit
<i>
ought
</i>
to be given, (instead of "shall "); and, in the
next clause, the
<i>
legislature shall
</i>
, (instead of, the congress "
<i>
may
</i>
");
and in the concluding clause, "and the effect, which judgments
obtained in one state shall have in another," (instead of, "
<i>
and
the effect thereof
</i>
.") The latter was substituted by the vote of
six states against three; the others were adopted without opposition; and
the whole clause, as thus mended, passed without any division.

§ 1299.
</b>
It is well known, that the laws
and acts of foreign nations are not judicially taken notice of in any
other nation; and that they must be proved, like any other facts, whenever
they come into operation or examination in any forensic controversy. The
nature and mode of the proof depend upon the municipal law of the country,
where the suit is depending; and there are known to be great diversities
in the practice of different nations on this subject. Even in England and
America the subject, notwithstanding the numerous judicial decisions,
which have from time to time been made, is not without its difficulties
and embarrassments.

§ 1300.
</b>
Independent of the question as
to
<i>
proof
</i>
, there is another question, as to the
<i>
effect
</i>
,
which is to be given to foreign judgments, when duly authenticated, in the
tribunals of other nations, either as matter to maintain a suit, or to
found a defence to a suit. Upon this subject, also, different nations are
not entirely agreed in opinion or practice. Most, if not all of them,
profess to give some effect to such judgments; but many exceptions are
allowed, which either demolish the whole efficiency of the judgment, as
such, or leave it open to collateral proofs, which in a great measure
impair its validity. To treat suitably of this subject would require a
large dissertation, and appropriately belongs to another branch of public
law.

§ 1301.
</b>
The general rule of the common
law, recognised both in England and America, is, that foreign judgments
are
<i>
primâ facie
</i>
evidence of the right and matter, which they
purport to decide. At least, this may be asserted to be in England the
preponderating weight of opinion; and in America it has been held, upon
many occasions,
<a href="#006">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
though
its correctness has been recently questioned, upon principle and
authority, with much acuteness.

§ 1302.
</b>
Before the revolution, the
colonies were deemed foreign to each other, as the British colonies are
still deemed foreign to the mother country, and, of course, their
judgments were deemed foreign judgments within the scope of the foregoing
rule.
<a href="#008">
<b>
<sup>
8
</sup>
</b>
</a>
It followed,
that the judgments of one colony were deemed re-examinable in another, not
only as to the jurisdiction of the court, which pronounced them; but also
as to the merits of the controversy, to the extent, in which they were
then understood to be re-examinable in England. In some of the colonies,
however, laws had been passed, which put judgments in the neighbouring
colonies upon a like footing with domestic judgments, as to their
conclusiveness, when the court possessed jurisdiction.
<a href="#009">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
The reasonable construction of the article of the confederation on this
subject is, that it was intended to give the same conclusive effect to
judgments of all the states, so as to promote uniformity, as well as
certainty, in the rule among them. It is probable, that it did not
invariably, and perhaps not generally, receive such a construction; and
the amendment in the constitution was, without question, designed to cure
the defects in the existing provision.

§ 1302[a].
</b>
The clause of the
constitution propounds three distinct objects; first, to declare, that
full faith and credit shall be given to the records, &amp;c. of every
other state; secondly, to prescribe the manner of authenticating them; and
thirdly, to prescribe their effect, when so authenticated. The first is
declared, and established by the constitution itself, and is to receive no
aid, nor is it susceptible of any qualification by congress. The other two
are expressly subjected to the legislative power.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1303">

<b>
§ 1303.
</b>
Let us then examine, what is
the true meaning and interpretation of each section of the clause. "Full
faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records,
and judicial proceedings of every other state." The language is
positive, and declaratory, leaving nothing to future legislation. "Full
faith and credit
<i>
shall
</i>
be given;" what, then, is meant by
full faith and credit? Does it import no more than, that the same faith
and credit are to be given to them, which, by the comity of nations, is
ordinarily conceded to all foreign judgments? Or is it intended to give
them a more conclusive efficiency, approaching to, if not identical with,
that of domestic judgments; so that, if the jurisdiction of the court be
established, the judgment shall be conclusive, as to the merits? The
latter seems to be the true object of the clause; and, indeed, it seems
difficult to assign any other adequate motive for the insertion of the
clause, both in the confederation and in the constitution. The framers of
both instruments must be presumed to have known, that by the general
comity of nations, and the long established rules of the common law, both
in England and America, foreign judgments were
<i>
primâ facie
</i>
evidence of their own correctness. They might be impugned for their
injustice, or irregularity; but they were admitted to be a good ground of
action here, and stood firm, until impeached and overthrown by competent
evidence, introduced by the adverse party. It is hardly conceivable, that
so much solicitude should have been exhibited to introduce, as between
confederated states, much less between states united under the same
national government, a clause merely affirmative of an established rule of
law, and not denied to the humblest, or most distant foreign nation. It
was hardly supposable, that the states would deal less favourably with
each other on such a subject, where they could not but have a common
interest, than with foreigners. A motive of a higher kind must naturally
have directed them to the provision. It must have been, "to form a
more perfect Union;" and to give to each state a higher security and
confidence in the others, by attributing a superior sanctity and
conclusiveness to the public acts and judicial proceedings of all. There
could be no reasonable objection to such a course. On the other hand,
there were many reasons in its favour. The states were united in an
indissoluble bond with each other. The commercial and other intercourse
with each other would be constant, and infinitely diversified. Credit
would be every where given and received; and rights and property would
belong to citizens of every state in many other states than that, in which
they resided. Under such circumstances it could scarcely consist with the
peace of society, or with the interest and security of individuals, with
the public or with private good, that questions and titles, once
deliberately tried and decided in one state, should be open to litigation
again and again, as often as either of the parties, or their privies,
should choose to remove from one jurisdiction to another. It would
occasion infinite injustice, after such trial and decision, again to open
and re-examine all the merits of the case. It might be done at a distance
from the original place of the transaction; after the removal or death of
witnesses, or the loss of other testimony; after a long lapse of time, and
under circumstances wholly unfavourable to a just understanding of the
case.

<p>
<a id="1304">

<b>
§ 1304.
</b>
If it should be said, that the
judgment might be unjust upon the merits, or erroneous in point in law,
the proper answer is, that if true, that would furnish no ground for
interference; for the evils of a new trial would be greater, than it would
cure. Every such judgment ought to be presumed to be correct, and founded
in justice. And what security is there, that the new judgment, upon the
re-examination, would be more just, or more conformable to law, than the
first? What state has a right to proclaim, that the judgments of its own
courts are better founded in law or in justice, than those of any other
state? The evils of introducing a general system of re-examination of the
judicial proceedings of other states, whose connexions are so intimate,
and whose rights are so interwoven with our own, would far outweigh any
supposable benefits from an imagined superior justice in a few cases.
<a href="#011">
<b>
<sup>
11
</sup>
</b>
</a>
Motives of this sort,
founded upon an enlarged confidence, and reciprocal duties, might well be
presumed to have entered into the minds of the framers of the
confederation, and the constitution. They intended to give, not only faith
and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of each
of the states, such as belonged to those of all foreign nations and
tribunals; but to give to them full faith and credit; that is, to
attribute to them positive and absolute verity, so that they cannot be
contradicted, or the truth of them be denied, any more than in the state,
where they originated.

§ 1305.
</b>
The next section of the clause
is, "And the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner, in
which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, —
<i>
and
the effect thereof
</i>
." It is obvious, that this clause, so far as
it authorizes congress to prescribe the mode of authentication, is wholly
beside the purpose of the preceding. Whatever may be the faith and credit
due to the public acts, records, and proceedings of other states, whether
<i>
primâ facie
</i>
evidence only, or conclusive evidence; still the
mode of establishing them in proof is of very great importance, and upon
which a diversity of rules exists in different countries. The object of
the present provision is to introduce uniformity in the rules of proof,
(which could alone be done by congress.) It is certainly a great
improvement upon the parallel article of the confederation. That left it
wholly to the states themselves to require any proof of public acts,
records, and proceedings, which they might from time to time deem
advisable; and where no rule was prescribed, the subject was open to the
decision of the judicial tribunals, according to their own views of the
local usage and jurisprudence. Many embarrassments must necessarily have
grown out of such a state of things. The provision, therefore, comes
recommended by every consideration of wisdom and convenience, of public
peace, and private security.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1306">
</a>
<b>
§ 1306.
</b>
But the clause does not stop
here. The words added are, "and the effect thereof." Upon the
proper interpretation of these words some diversity of opinion has been
judicially expressed. Some learned judges have thought, that the word "thereof"
had reference to the proof, or authentication; so as to read, "and to
prescribe the effect of such proof, or authentication." Others have
thought, that it referred to the antecedent words, "acts, records,
and proceedings;" so as to read, "and to prescribe the effect of
such acts, records, and proceedings."
<a href="#013">
<b>
<sup>

</sup>
</b>
</a>
Those, who were of opinion, that the preceding section of the clause made
judgments in one state conclusive in all others, naturally adopted the
former opinion; for otherwise the power to declare the effect would be
wholly senseless; or congress could possess the power to repeal, or vary
the full faith and credit given by that section. Those, who were of
opinion, that such judgments were not conclusive, but only
<i>
primâ
facie
</i>
evidence, as naturally embraced the other opinion; and supposed,
that until congress should, by law, declare what the effect of such
judgment should be, they remained only
<i>
primâ facie
</i>
evidence.
</p>
<p>
<a id="1307">
</a>
<b>
§ 1307.
</b>
The former seems now to be
considered the sounder interpretation. But it is not, practically
speaking, of much importance, which interpretation prevails; since each
admits the competency of congress to declare the effect of judgments, when
duly authenticated; so always, that full faith and credit are given to
them; and congress by their legislation have already carried into
operation the objects of the clause. The act of 26th of May, 1790, (ch.
11,) after providing for the mode of authenticating the acts, records, and
judicial proceedings of the states, has declared, "and the said
records and judicial proceedings, authenticated as aforesaid, shall have
<i>
such
</i>
faith and credit given to them in every court within the
United States, as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state,
from whence the said records are or shall be taken."
<a href="#014">
<b>
<sup>
14
</sup>
</b>
</a>
It has been settled upon solemn argument, that this enactment does declare
the effect of the records, as evidence, when duly authenticated. It gives
them the same faith and credit, as they have in the state court, from
which they are taken. If in such court they have the faith and credit of
the highest nature, that is to say, of
<i>
record
</i>
evidence, they must
have the same faith and credit in every other court. So, that congress
have declared the
<i>
effect
</i>
of the records, by declaring, what degree
of faith and credit shall be given to them. If a judgment is conclusive in
the state, where it is pronounced, it is equally conclusive every where.
If re-examinable there, it is open to the same inquiries in every other
state.
<a href="#015">
<b>
<sup>
15
</sup>
</b>
</a>
It is,
therefore, put upon the same footing, as a domestic judgment. But this
does not prevent an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court, in which
the original judgment was given, to pronounce it; or the right of the
state itself to exercise authority over the persons, or the subject
matter. The constitution did not mean to confer a new power or
jurisdiction; but simply to regulate the effect of the acknowledged
jurisdiction over persons and things within the territory.
