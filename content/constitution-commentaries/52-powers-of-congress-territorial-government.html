next clause of the same article is, "The congress shall have power to
dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the
territory and other property belonging to the United States; and nothing
in this constitution shall be so construed, as to prejudice any claims of
the United States, or of any particular state." The proviso thus
annexed to the power is certainly proper in itself, and was probably
rendered necessary by the jealousies and questions concerning the Western
territory, which have been already alluded to under the preceding head.

It was perhaps suggested by the
clause in the ninth article of the confederation, which contained a
proviso, "that no state shall be deprived of territory for the
benefit of the United States."

§ 1317.
</b>
The power itself was obviously
proper, in order to escape from the constitutional objection already
stated to the power of congress over the territory ceded to the United
States under the confederation. The clause was not in the original draft
of the constitution; but was added by the vote of ten states against one.

§ 1318.
</b>
As the general government
possesses the right to acquire territory, either by conquest, or by
treaty, it would seem to follow, as an inevitable consequence, that it
possesses the power to govern, what it has so acquired. The territory does
not, when so acquired, become entitled to self-government, and it is not
subject to the jurisdiction of any state. It must, consequently, be under
the dominion and jurisdiction of the Union, or it would be without any
government at all.

</a>
In cases of
conquest, the usage of the world is, if a nation is not wholly subdued, to
consider the conquered territory, as merely held by military occupation,
until its fate shall be determined by a treaty of peace. But during this
intermediate period it is exclusively subject to the government of the
conqueror. In cases of confirmation or cession by treaty, the acquisition
becomes firm and stable; and the ceded territory becomes a part of the
nation, to which it is annexed, either on terms stipulated in the treaty,
or on such, as its new master shall impose. The relations of the
inhabitants with each other do not change; but their relations with their
former sovereign are dissolved; and new relations are created between them
and their new sovereign. The act transferring the country transfers the
allegiance of its inhabitants. But the general laws, not strictly
political, remain, as they were, until altered by the new sovereign. If
the treaty stipulates, that they shall enjoy the privileges, rights, and
immunities of citizens of the United States, the treaty, as a part of the
law of the land, becomes obligatory in these respects. Whether the same
effects would result from the mere fact of their becoming inhabitants and
citizens by the cession, without any express stipulation, may deserve
inquiry, if the question should ever occur. But they do not participate in
political power; nor can they share in the powers of the general
government, until they become a state, and are admitted into the Union, as
such. Until that period, the territory remains subject to be governed in
such manner, as congress shall direct, under the clause of the
constitution now under consideration.

§ 1319.
</b>
No one has ever doubted the
authority of congress to erect territorial governments within the
territory of the United States, under the general language of the clause,
"to make all needful rules and regulations." Indeed, with the
ordinance of 1787 in the very view of the framers, as well as of the
people of the states, it is impossible to doubt, that such a power was
deemed indispensable to the purposes of the cessions made by the states.
So that, notwithstanding the generality of the objection, (already
examined,) that congress has no power to erect corporations, and that in
the convention the power was refused; we see, that the very power is an
incident to that of regulating the territory of the United States; that
is, it is an appropriate means of carrying the power into effect.

</a>
What shall be the form of government established in the territories
depends exclusively upon the discretion of congress. Having a right to
erect a territorial government, they may confer on it such powers,
legislative, judicial, and executive, as they may deem best. They may
confer upon it general legislative powers, subject only to the laws and
constitution of the United States. If the power to create courts is given
to the territorial legislature, those courts are to be deemed strictly
territorial; and in no just sense constitutional courts, in which the
judicial power conferred by the constitution can be deposited. They are
incapable of receiving it. They are legislative courts, created in virtue
of the general right of sovereignty in the government, or in virtue of
that clause, which enables congress to make all needful rules and
regulations respecting the territory of the United States.

</a>
The power is not confined to the territory of the United States; but
extends to "other property belonging to the United States;" so
that it may be applied to the due regulation of all other personal and
real property rightfully belonging to the United States. And so it has
been constantly understood, and acted upon.

§ 1320.
</b>
As if it were not possible to
confer a single power upon the national government, which ought not to be
a source of jealousy, the present has not been without objection. It has
been suggested, that the sale and disposal of the Western territory may
become a source of such immense revenue to the national government, as to
make it independent of, and formidable to, the people. To amass immense
riches (it has been said) to defray the expenses of ambition, when
occasion may prompt, without seeming to oppress the people, has uniformly
been the policy of tyrants. Should such a policy creep into our
government, and the sales of the public lands, instead of being
appropriated to the discharge of the public debt, be converted to a
treasure in a bank, those, who, at any time, can command it, may be
tempted to apply it to the most nefarious purposes. The improvident
alienation of the crown lands in England has been considered, as a
circumstance extremely favourable to the liberty of the nation, by
rendering the government less independent of the people. The same reason
will apply to other governments, whether monarchical or republican.

§ 1321.
</b>
What a strange representation
is this of a republican government, created by, and responsible to, the
people in all its departments! What possible analogy can there be between
the possession of large revenues in the hands of a monarch, and large
revenues in the possession of a government, whose administration is
confided to the chosen agents of the people for a short period, and may be
dismissed almost at pleasure? If the doctrine be true, which is here
inculcated, a republican government is little more than a dream, however
its administration may be organized; and the people are not worthy of
being trusted with large public revenues, since they cannot provide
against corruption, and abuses of them. Poverty alone (it seems) gives a
security for fidelity; and the liberties of the people are safe only, when
they are pressed into vigilance by the power of taxation. In the view of
this doctrine, what is to be thought of the recent purchases of Louisiana
and Florida? If there was danger before, how mightily must it be increased
by the accession of such a vast extent of territory, and such a vast
increase of resources? Hitherto, the experience of the country has
justified no alarms on this subject from such a source. On the other hand,
the public lands hold out, after the discharge of the national debt, ample
revenues to be devoted to the cause of education and sound learning, and
to internal improvements, without trenching upon the property, or
embarrassing the pursuits of the people by burthensome taxation. The
constitutional objection to the appropriation of the other revenues of the
government to such objects has not been supposed to apply to an
appropriation of the proceeds of the public lands. The cessions of that
territory were expressly made for the common benefit of the United States;
and therefore constitute a fund, which may be properly devoted to any
objects, which are for the common benefit of the Union.

§ 1322.
</b>
The power of congress over the
public territory is clearly exclusive and universal; and their legislation
is subject to no control; but is absolute, and unlimited, unless so far as
it is affected by stipulations in the cessions, or by the ordinance of
1787, under which any part of it has been settled.

But the power of congress to regulate the other national property (unless
it has acquired, by cession of the states, exclusive jurisdiction) is not
necessarily exclusive in all cases. If the national government own a fort,
arsenal, hospital, or lighthouse establishment, not so ceded, the general
jurisdiction of the state is not excluded in regard to the site; but,
subject to the rightful exercise of the powers of the national government,
it remains in full force.

§ 1323.
</b>
There are some other incidental
powers given to congress, to carry into effect certain other provisions of
the constitution. But they will most properly come under consideration in
a future part of these Commentaries. At present, it may suffice to say,
that with reference to due energy in the government, due protection of the
national interests, and due security to the Union, fewer powers could
scarcely have been granted, without jeoparding [sic] the whole system.
Without the power of the purse, the power to declare war, or to promote
the common defence, or general welfare, would have been wholly vain and
illusory. Without the power exclusively to regulate commerce, the
intercourse between the states would have been constantly liable to
domestic dissensions, jealousies, and rivalries, and to foreign
hostilities, and retaliatory restrictions. The other powers are
principally auxiliary to these; and are dictated at once by an enlightened
policy, a devotion to justice, and a regard to the permanence (may it
ripen into a perpetuity!) of the Union.

§ 1324.
</b>
As there are incidental powers
belonging to the United States in their sovereign capacity, so there are
incidental rights, obligations, and duties. It may be asked, how these are
to be ascertained. In the first place, as to duties and obligations of a
public nature, they are to be ascertained by the law of nations, to which,
on asserting our independence, we necessarily became subject. In regard to
municipal rights and obligations, whatever differences of opinion may
arise in regard to the extent, to which the common law attaches to the
national government, no one can doubt, that it must, and ought to be
resorted to, in order to ascertain many of its rights and obligations.
Thus, when a contract is entered into by the United States, we naturally
and necessarily resort to the common law, to interpret its terms, and
ascertain its obligations. The same general rights, duties, and
limitations, which the common law attaches to contracts of a similar
character between private individuals, are applied to the contracts of the
government. Thus, if the United States become the holder of a bill of
exchange, they are bound to the same diligence, as to giving notice, in
order to change an indorser, upon the dishonour of the bill, as a private
holder would be.

</a>
In like
manner, when a bond is entered into by a surety for the faithful discharge
of the duties of an office by his principal, the nature and extent of the
obligation, created by the instrument, are constantly ascertained by
reference to the common law; though the bond is given to the government in
its sovereign capacity.

<li><a id="011"></a>Among the extraordinary opinionsof Mr. Jefferson, in regard to government in general, and especially tothe government of the United States, none strikes. the calm observer withmore force, than the cool and calculating manner, in which lie surveys theprobable occurrence of domestic rebellions. "I am," he says, "nota friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive. Itplaces the governors, indeed, more at their ease, at the expense of thepeople. The late rebellion in Massachusetts (in 1787) has given morealarm, than I think it should have done. Calculate, that one rebellion inthirteen states, in the course of eleven years, is but one for each state,in a century and a half.No country should be so long without one.Nor will any degree of power in the hands of government preventinsurrections." Letter to Mr. Madison, in 1787, 2 Jefferson'sCorresp. 276. Is it not surprising, that any statesman should haveoverlooked the horrible evils, and immense expenses, which are attendantupon every rebellion? The loss of life, the summary exercise of militarypower, the desolations of the country, and the inordinate expenditures, towhich every rebellion must give rise? Is not the great object of everygood government to preserve, and perpetuate domestic peace, and thesecurity of property, and the reasonable enjoyment of private rights, andpersonal liberty? If a state is to be torn into factions, and civil wars,every eleven years, is not the whole Union to become a common sufferer?How, and when are such wars to terminate? Are the insurgents to meetvictory or defeat? Has not history established the melancholy truth, thatconstant wars lead to military dictatorship, and despotism, and areinconsistent with the free spirit of republican governments? If thetranquillity of the Union is to be disturbed every eleventh year by acivil war, what repose can there be for the citizens, in their ordinarypursuits? Will they not soon become tired of a republican government,which invites to such eternal contests, ending in blood, and murder, andrapine? One cannot but feel far more sympathy with the opinion of Mr.Jefferson, in the same letter, in which he expounds the great politicalmaxim, "Educate and inform the whole mass of the people." 9Jefferson's Corresp. 276. 12.United States v.
