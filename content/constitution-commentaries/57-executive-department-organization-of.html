 § 1404. IN the progress of our examination of the constitution,
we are now
arrived at the second article, which contains an enumeration of the
organization and powers of the executive department.  What is the best
constitution for the executive department, and what are the powers, with
which it should be entrusted, are problems among the most important, and
probably the most difficult to be satisfactorily solved, of all, which are
involved in the theory of free governments.

 No man, who has ever studied
the subject with profound attention, has risen from the labour without an
increased and almost overwhelming sense of its intricate relations, and
perplexing doubts.  No man, who has ever deeply read the human history, and
especially the history of republics, but has been struck with the
consciousness, how little has been hitherto done to establish a safe
depositary of power in any hands; and how often in the hands of one, or a
few, or many, of an hereditary monarch, or an elective chief, the executive
power has brought ruin upon the state, or sunk under the oppressive burthen
of its own imbecility.  Perhaps our own history, hitherto, does not
establish, that we have wholly escaped all the dangers; and that here is
not to be found, as has been the case in other nations, the vulnerable part
of the republic.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1405.
 </b>
 It appears, that the subject underwent a very
elaborate discussion
in the convention, with much
</p>
<p>
 diversity of opinion; and various propositions were submitted of the most
opposite character.  The Federalist has remarked, that there is hardly any
part of the system, the arrangement of which could have been attended with
greater difficulty; and none, which has been inveighed against with less
candor, of criticised with less judgment.

  § 1406.
 </b>
 The first clause of the first section of the second
article is as
follows: "The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America.  He shall hold his office during the term of four years;
and together with the Vice-President, chosen for the same term, be chosen
as follows."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1407.
 </b>
 Under the confederation there was no national
executive.  The
whole powers of the national government were vested in a congress,
consisting of a single body; and that body was authorized to appoint a
committee of the states, composed of one delegate from every state, to sit
in the recess, and to delegate to them such of their own powers, not
requiring the consent of nine states, as nine states should consent to.
 <sup>
  <a href="#3">

  </a>
 </sup>
 This want of a national executive was deemed a fatal defect in the
confederation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1408.
 </b>
 In the convention, there does not seem to have been
any objection
to the establishment of a national executive.  But upon the question,
whether it should consist of a single person, the affirmative w. as carried
by a vote of seven states against three.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">

  </a>
 </sup>
 The term of service was at first
fixed at seven years, by a vote of five states against four, one being
divided.  The term was afterwards altered to four years, upon the report of
a
</p>
<p>
 committee, and adopted by the vote of ten states against one.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1409.
 </b>
 In considering this clause, three practical questions are
naturally suggested: First, whether there should be a distinct executive
department; secondly, whether it should be composed of more than one
person; and, thirdly, what should be the duration of office.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1410.
 </b>
 Upon the first question, little need be said. All
America have at
length concurred in the propriety of establishing a distinct executive
department.  The principle is embraced in every state constitution; and it
seems now to be assumed among us, as a fundamental maxim of government,
that the legislative, executive, and judicial departments ought to be
separate, and the powers of one ought not to be exercised by either of the
others.  The same maxim is found recognised in express terms in many of our
state constitutions.  It is hardly necessary to repeat, that where all these
powers are united in the same hands, there is a real despotism, to the
extent of their coercive exercise.  Where, on the other hand, they exist
together, and yet depend for their exercise upon the mere authority of
recommendation, (as they did under the confederation,
 <sup>
  <a href="#6">
   6
  </a>
 </sup>
 ) they become at once
imbecile and arbitrary, subservient to popular clamour, and incapable of
steady action.  The harshness of the measures in relation to paper money,
and the timidity and vacillation in relation to military affairs, are
examples not easily to be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1411.
 </b>
 Taking it, then, for granted, that there ought to be an
executive
department, the next consideration is, how it ought to be organized.  It
may be stated in general terms, that that organization is best, which will
at once secure energy in the executive, and safety to the people. The
notion, however, is not uncommon, and occasionally finds ingenious
advocates, that a vigorous executive is inconsistent with the genius of a
republican government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#7">
   7
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is difficult to find any sufficient grounds, on
which to rest this notion; and those, which are usually stated, belong
principally to that class of minds, which readily indulge in the belief of
the general perfection, as well as perfectibility, of human nature, and
deem the least possible quantity of power, with which government can
subsist, to be the best.  To those, who look abroad into the world, and
attentively read the history of other nations, ancient and modern, far
different lessons are taught with a severe truth and force.  Those lessons
instruct them, that energy in the executive is a leading character in the
definition of a good government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#8">

  </a>
 </sup>
 It is essential to the protection of the
community against foreign attacks.
</p>
<p>
 It is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws, to the
protection of property against those irregular and high-handed
combinations, which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice, and
to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of
ambition, of faction, and of anarchy.
 <sup>
  <a href="#9">

 Every man the least conversant with
Roman history knows, how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in
the absolute power of a single man, under the formidable name of a
dictator, as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals, aspiring
to tyranny, and the seditions of whole classes of the community,
threatening the existence of the government, as against foreign enemies,
menacing the destruction and conquest of the state.
 <sup>

 A feeble executive
implies a feeble execution of the government.  A feeble execution is but
another phrase for a bad execution; and a government ill executed, whatever
may be its theory, must, in practice, be a bad government.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1412.
 </b>
 The ingredients, which constitute energy in the
executive, are
unity, duration, an adequate provision for its support, and competent
powers.  The ingredients, which constitute safety in a republican form of
government, are a due dependence on the people, and a due responsibility to
the people.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1413.
 </b>
 The most distinguished statesmen have uniformly
maintained the
doctrine, that there ought to be a single executive, and a numerous
legislature. They have considered energy, as the most necessary
qualification of the power, and this as best attained by
</p>
<p>
 reposing the power in a single hand.  At the same time, they have
considered with equal propriety, that a numerous legislature was best
adapted to the duties of legislation, and best calculated to conciliate the
confidence of the people, and to secure. their privileges and interests.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">
   13
  </a>
 </sup>
 Montesquieu has said, that. "the executive power ought to be in the hands
of a monarch, because this branch of government, having need of despatch,
is better administered by one, than by many.  On the other hand, whatever
depends on the legislative power is oftentimes. better regulated by many,
than by a single person.  But if there were no monarch, and the executive.
power should be committed to a certain number of persons, selected from the
legislative body, there would be an end to liberty; by reason, that the two
powers. would be united, as the same persons would sometimes possess, and
would always be able to possess, a share in both."
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 De Lolme, in addition
to other advantages, considers the unity o{ the executive as important in a
free government, because it is thus more easily restrained.
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
 "In those
states," says he, "where the execution of the laws is entrusted to several
different hands, and to each with different titles and prerogatives, such
division, and such changeableness of measures, which must be the
consequence of it, constantly hide the true cause of the evils of the
state. Sometimes military tribunes, and at others consuls bear an absolute
sway.  Sometimes patricians usurp every thing; and at other times those,
who are called nobles.  Sometimes the people. are oppressed by de-
</p>
<p>
 cemvirs; and at others by dictators.  Tyranny in such states does not
always beat down the fences, that are set around it; but it leaps over
them.  When men think it confined to one place, it starts up again in
another.  It mocks the efforts of the people, not because it is invincible,
but because it is unknown.  But the indivisibility of the public power in
England has constantly kept the views and efforts of the people directed to
one and the same object."
 <sup>
  <a href="#16">
   16
  </a>
 </sup>
 He adds, in another place, "we must observe a
difference between the legislative and executive powers.  The latter may be
confined, and even is the more easily so, when undivided.  The legislature
on the contrary, in order to its being restrained, should absolutely be
divided."
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1414.
 </b>
 That unity is conducive to energy will scarcely be
disputed.
Decision, activity, secrecy, and despatch will generally characterise the
proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree, than the proceedings
of a greater number; and in proportion, as the number is increased, these
qualities will be diminished.
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">
   18
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1415.
 </b>
 This unity may be destroyed in two ways; first, by
vesting the
power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity; secondly, by vesting it
ostensibly in one man, subject, however, in whole or in part to the control
and advice of a council.  Of the first, the two consuls of Rome may serve,
as an example in ancient times; and in modern times, the brief and hasty
</p>
<p>
 history or the three consuls off France, during its shortlived republic.
 <sup>
  <a href="#19">
   19
  </a>
 </sup>
 Of the latter, several states in the Union furnish examples, as some of the
colonies did before the revolution.  Both these methods or destroying the
unity of the executive have had their advocates.  They are both liable to
similar, if not to equal objections,
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1416.
 </b>
 The experience of other nations, so far as it goes,
coincides with
what theory would point out. The Roman history records may instances of
mischiefs to the republic from dissensions between the consuls, and between
the military tribunes, who were at times substituted instead of the
consuls.  Those dissensions would have been even more striking, as well as
more frequent, if it had not been for the peculiar circumstances of that
republic, which often induced the consuls to divide the administration of
the government between them.  And as the consuls were generally chosen from
the Patrician order, which was engaged in perpetual struggles with the
Plebeians for the preservation of the privileges and dignities of their own
order; there was an external pressure, which compelled them to act together
for mutual support and defence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#21">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1417.
 </b>
 But independent of any of the lights derived from
history, it is
obvious, that a division of the executive power between two or more persons
must always tend to produce dissensions, and fluctuating councils.
Whenever two or more persons are engaged
</p>
<p>
 in any common enterprise, or pursuit, there is always danger of difference
of opinion.  If it be a public trust, or office, in which they are clothed
with equal dignity and authority, there are peculiar dangers arising from
personal emulation, or personal animosity; from superior talents on one
side, encountering strong jealousies on the other; from pride of opinion on
one side, and weak devotion to popular prejudices on the other; from the
vanity of being the author of a plan, or resentment from some imagined
slight by the approval of that of another. From these, and other causes of
the like nature, the most bitter rivalries and dissensions often spring.
Whenever these happen, they lessen the respectability, weaken the
authority, and distract the plans and operations of those, whom they
divide.  The wisest measures are those often defeated, or delayed, even in
the most critical moments.  And what constitutes even a greater evil, the
community often becomes split up into rival factions, adhering to the
different persons, who compose the magistracy; and temporary animosities
become thus the foundation of permanent calamities to the state.
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
 Indeed,
the ruinous effects of rival factions in free states, struggling for power,
has been the constant theme of reproach by the admirers of monarchy, and of
regret by the lovers of republics.  The Guelphs and the Ghibelins, the
white and the black factions, have been immortalized in the history of the
Italian states; and they are but an epitome of the same unvarying scenes in
all other republics.
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1418.
 </b>
 From the very nature of a free government, inconveniences
resulting from a division of power must
</p>
<p>
 be submitted to, in the formation of the legislature. But it is unwise, as
well as unnecessary, in the constitution of the executive.  In the
legislature promptitude of decision is not of great importance.  It is more
often an evil, than a benefit.  Differences of opinion in that department
may, indeed, sometimes retard salutary measures; but they often lead to
more circumspection and deliberation, and to more perfection and accuracy
in the laws.  A resolution, once passed by a legislative body, becomes a
law; and opposition to it is either illegal or impolitic.  Before it
becomes a law, opposition may diminish the mischiefs, or increase the good
of the measure.  But no favourable circumstances palliate, or atone for the
disadvantages of dissension in the executive department.  The evils are
here pure and unmixed.  They embarrass and weaken every plan, to which they
relate, from the first step to the final conclusion.  They constantly
counteract the most important ingredients in the executive character,
vigour, expedition, and certainty of operation.  In peace, distraction of
the executive councils is sufficiently alarming and mischievous.  But in
war, it prostrates all energy, and all security.  It brings triumph to the
enemy, and disgrace to the country.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1419.
 </b>
 Objections of a like nature apply, though in some
respects with
diminished force, to the scheme of an executive council, whose
constitutional concurrence is rendered indispensable.  An artful cabal in
that council would be able to distract and enervate the whole public
councils.  And even without such a cabal, the mere diversity of views and
opinions would almost always mark the exercise of the executive authority
with a spirit of habitual feebleness and dilatoriness, or a degrading
inconsistency.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 But an objection, in a republican government quite as
weighty, is, that such a participation in the executive power has a direct
tendency to conceal faults, and destroy responsibility. Responsibility is
of two kinds, to censure, and to punishment.  The first is the more
important of the two, especially in an elective government.  Men in public
trust will more often act in such a manner, as to render them unworthy of
public favour, than to render themselves liable to legal punishment.  But
the multiplication of voices in the business of the executive renders it
difficult to fix responsibility of either kind; for it is perpetually
shifted from one to. another.  It often becomes impossible amidst mutual
accusations to determine, upon whom the blame ought to rest.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">
   26
  </a>
 </sup>
 A sense of
mutual impropriety sometimes induces the parties to resort to plausible
pretexts to disguise their misconduct; or a dread of public responsibility
to cover up,
</p>
<p>
 under the lead of some popular demagogue, their own faults and
vacillations. -- Thus, a council often becomes the means, either of
shifting off all effective responsibility from the chief magistrate, or of
intrigues and oppositions, which destroy his power, and supplant his
influence.  The constant excuse, for want of decision and public spirit on
his part, will be, that he has been overruled by his council; and on
theirs, that he would not listen to sound advice, or resisted a cordial
co-operation.  In regard to the ordinary operations of government, the
general result is to introduce a system of bargaining and management into
the executive councils; and an equally mischievous system of corruption and
intrigue in the choice and appointment of counsellors.  Offices are
bestowed on unworthy persons to gratify a leading member, or mutual
concessions are made to cool opposition, and disarm enmity.  It is but too
true, that in those states, where executive councils exist, the chief
magistrate either sinks into comparative insignificance, or sustains his
power by arrangements, neither honourable to himself, nor salutary to the
people. He is sometimes compelled to follow, when he ought to lead; and he
is sometimes censured for acts, over which he has no control, and for
appointments to office, which have been wrung from him by a sort of
political necessity.

 <b>
  § 1420.
 </b>
 The proper conclusion to be drawn from these
considerations is,
that .plurality in the executive deprives the people of the two greatest
securities for the faithful exercise of delegated power.  First, it removes
the just restraints of public opinion; and, secondly, it diminishes the
means, as well as the power, of fixing responsibility for bad measures upon
the real authors.

 <b>
  § 1421.
 </b>
 The case of the king of Great Britain is adduced, as a
proof the
other way; but it is a case wholly inapplicable to the circumstances of our
republic.  In Great Britain there is an hereditary magistrate; and it is a
settled maxim in that government, that he can do no wrong; the true meaning
of which is, that, for the sake of the public peace, he shall not be
accountable for his administration of public affairs, and his person shall
be sacred.  In that kingdom it is, therefore, wise, that he should have a
constitutional council, at once to advise him in regard to measures, and to
become responsible for those measures.  In no other way could any
responsibility be brought home to the executive department.  Still the king
is not bound by the advice of his council.  He is the absolute master of
his own conduct; and the only alternative left to the ministry is, to
compel him to follow their advice, or to resign the administration of the
government.  In the American republic the case is wholly different.  The
executive magistrate is chosen by, and made responsible to, the people;
and, therefore, it is most fit, that he should have the exclusive
management of the affairs, for which he is thus made responsible.  In
short, the reason for a council in Great Britain is the very reason for
rejecting it in America.  The object, in such case, is to secure executive
energy and responsibility.  In Great Britain it is secured by a council.
In America it would be defeated by one.

 <b>
  § 1422.
 </b>
 The idea of a council to the executive, which has
prevailed to so
great an extent in the state constitutions, has, without doubt, been
derived from that
</p>
<p>
 maxim of republican jealousy, which considers power as safer in the hands
of a number of men, than of a single man.  It is a misapplication of a
known rule, that in the multitude of counsel there is safety.  If it were
even admitted, that the maxim is justly applicable to the executive
magistracy, there are disadvantages on the other side, which greatly
overbalance it.  But in truth, all multiplication of the executive is
rather dangerous, than friendly to liberty; and it is more sale to have a
single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people, than many.
 <sup>
  <a href="#30">
   30
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is in the highest degree probable, that the peculiar situation, in which
the American states were placed antecedently to the revolution, with
colonial governors placed over them by the crown, and irresponsible to
themselves, gave a sanction to the opinion of the value of an executive
council, and of the dangers of a single magistrate, wholly disproportionate
to its importance, and inconsistent with the permanent safety and dignity
of an elective republic.
 <sup>
  <a href="#31">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1423.
 </b>
 Upon the question, whether the executive should be
composed of a
single person, we have already seen, that there was, at first, a division
of opinion in the convention, which framed the constitution, seven stales
voting in the affirmative, and three in the negative; ultimately, however,
the vote was unanimous in its favour.
 <sup>
  <a href="#32">
   32
  </a>
 </sup>
 But the project of an executive
council was not so easily dismissed.  It was renewed at different periods
in various forms; and seems to have been finally, though
</p>
<p>
 indirectly, disposed of by the vote of eight states against three.
 <sup>
  <a href="#33">
   33
  </a>
 </sup>
 The
reasoning, which led to this conclusion, is understood to have been that,
which has been already stated, and which is most elaborately expounded in
the Federalist.
 <sup>

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1424.
 </b>
 The question as to the unity of the executive being
disposed of,
the next consideration is, as to the proper duration of his term of office.
It has been already mentioned, that duration in office constitutes an
essential requisite to the energy of the executive department.  This has
relation to two objects; first, the personal firmness of the chief
magistrate in the employment of his constitutional powers; and, secondly,
the stability of the system of administration, which may have been adopted
under his auspices.  With regard to the first, it is evident, that the
longer the duration in office, the greater will be the probability of
obtaining so important an advantage.  A man will naturally be interested in
whatever he possesses, in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of
the tenure, by which he holds it.  He will be less attached to what he
holds by a momentary, or uncertain title, than to what he enjoys by a title
durable, or certain; and of course he will be willing to risk more for the
one, than for the other. This remark is not less applicable to political
privilege, or honour, or trust, than to any article of ordinary property.
A chief magistrate, acting under the consciousness, that in a very short
time he must lay down office, will be apt to feel himself too little
interested in it to hazard any material censure or perplexity, from an
independent exercise of his powers, or from those ill hu-
</p>
<p>
 mours, which are apt at times to prevail in all governments.  If the case
should be, that he should, notwithstanding, be re-eligible, his wishes, if
he should have any for office, would combine with his fears to debase his
fortitude, or weaken his integrity, or enhance his irresolution.
 <sup>
  <a href="#35">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1425.
 </b>
 There are some, perhaps, who may be inclined to regard a
	servile
pliancy of the executive to a prevalent faction, or opinion in the
community, or in the legislature, as its best recommendation.  But such
notions betray a very imperfect knowledge of the true ends and objects of
government.  While republican principles demand, that the deliberate sense
of the community should govern the conduct of those, who administer their
affairs, it cannot escape observation, that transient impulses and sudden
excitements, caused by artful and designing men, often lead the people
astray, and require their rulers not to yield up their permanent interests
to any delusions of this sort.  It is a just observation, that the people
commonly intend the public good.  But no one, but a deceiver, will pretend,
that they do not often err, as to the best means of promoting it.  Indeed,
beset, .as they are, by the wiles of sycophants, the snares of the
ambitious and the avaricious, and the artifices of those, who possess their
confidence more, than they deserve, or seek to possess it by artful appeals
to their prejudices the wonder rather is, that their errors are not more
numerous and more mischievous.  It is the duty of their rulers to resist
such bad designs at all hazards; and it has not unfrequently happened, that
by such resistance they have saved the people from fatal mistakes, and, in
their moments of cooler reflection, obtained their gratitude and
</p>
<p>
 their reverence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#36">
   36
  </a>
 </sup>
 But how can resistance be expected, where the tenure of
office is so short, as to make it ineffectual and insecure?
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1426.
 </b>
 The same considerations apply with increased force to the
legislature.  If the executive department were to be subservient to the
wishes of the legislature, at all times and under all circumstances, the
whole objects of a partition of the powers of government would be defeated.
To what purpose would it be to separate the executive and judiciary from
the legislature, if both are to be so constituted, as to be at the absolute
devotion of the latter?  It is one thing to be subordinate to the laws; and
quite a different thing to be dependent upon the legislative body.  The
first comports with, the last violates, the fundamental principles of good
government; and, in fact, whatever may be the form of the constitution, the
last unites all power in the same hands.  The tendency of the legislative
authority to absorb every other has been already insisted on at large in
the preceding part of these Commentaries, and need not here be further
illustrated.  In governments purely republican it has been seen, that this
tendency is almost irresistible.  The representatives of the people are but
too apt to imagine, that they are the people themselves; and they betray
strong symptoms of impatience and even disgust at the least resistance from
any other quarter.  They seem to think the exercise of its proper rights by
the executive, or the judiciary, to be a breach of their privileges, and an
impeachment of their wisdom.
 <sup>
  <a href="#37">
   37
  </a>
 </sup>
 If, therefore, the executive is
</p>
<p>
 to constitute an effective, independent branch of the government, it is
indispensable to give it some permanence of duration in office, and some
motive for a firm exercise of its powers.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1427.
 </b>
 The other ground, that of stability in the system of
administration, is still more strikingly connected with duration in office.
Few men will be found willing to commit themselves to a course of policy,
whose wisdom may be perfectly clear to themselves, if they cannot be
permitted to complete, what they have begun.  Of what consequence will it
be to form the best plans of executive administration, if they are
perpetually passing into new hands, before they are matured, or may be
defeated at the moment, when their reasonableness and their value cannot be
understood, or realized by the public?  One of the truest rewards to
patriots and statesmen is the consciousness, that the objections raised
against their measures will disappear upon a fair trial; and that the
gratitude and affection the people will follow their labours, long after
they have ceased to be actors upon the public scenes.  But who will plant,
when he can never reap?  Who will sacrifice his present ease, and
reputation, and popularity, and encounter obloquy and persecution, for
systems, which he can neither mould so, as to ensure success, nor direct
so, as to justify the experiment?

  § 1428.

 The natural result of a change of the head of the
government will
be a change in the course of administration, as well as a change in the
subordinate persons, who are to act as ministers to the executive. A
successor in office will feel little sympathy with the plans of his
predecessor.  To undo what has been
</p>
<p>
 done by the latter will be supposed to give proofs of his own capacity; and
will recommend him to all those, who were adversaries of the past
administration; and perhaps will constitute the main grounds of elevating
him to office.  Personal pride: party principles, and an ambition for
public distinction will thus naturally prompt to an abandonment of old
schemes, and combine with that love of novelty so congenial to all free
states, to make every new administration the founders of new systems of
government.

  § 1429.

 What should be the proper duration of office is matter
of more
doubt and speculation.  On the one hand, it may be said, that the shorter
the period of office, the more security there will be against any dangerous
abuse of power.  The longer the period, the less will responsibility be
felt, and the more personal ambition will be indulged.  On the other hand,
the considerations above stated prove, that a very short period is,
practically speaking, equivalent to a surrender of the executive power, as
a check in government, or subjects it to an intolerable vacillation and
imbecility. In the convention itself much diversity of opinion existed on
this subject.  It was at one time proposed, that the executive should be
chosen during good behaviour.  But this proposition received little favour,
and seems to have been abandoned without much effort.

 Another proposition was (as has been seen) to choose the

for seven years, which at first passed by a bare majority;

 Another clause, "to be

 In this form the clause stood in the first draft

 But it was ultimately altered upon the report of a committee so, as

  § 1431.

 It is most probable, that these three propositions had
a mutual
influence upon the final vote. Those, who wished a choice to be made by the
people, rather than by the national legislature, would naturally incline to
a shorter period of office, than seven years. Those, who were in favour of
seven years, might be willing to consent to the clause against
re-eligibility, when they would resist it, if the period of office were
reduced to four years.
 <sup>
  <a href="#45">
   45

 And those, who favoured the latter, might more
readily yield the prohibitory clause, than increase the duration of office.
All this, however, is but conjecture; and the most, that can be gathered
</p>
<p>
 from the final result, is, that opinions, strongly maintained at the
beginning of the discussion, were yielded up in a spirit of compromise, or
abandoned upon the weight of argument.

  § 1432.

 It is observable, that the period actually fixed is
intermediate
between the term of office of the senate, and that of the house of
representatives. In the course of one presidential term, the house is, or
may be, twice recomposed; and two-thirds of the senate changed, or
re-elected. So far, as executive influence can be presumed to operate upon
either branch of the legislature unfavourably to the rights of the people,
the latter possess, in their elective franchise, ample means of redress.
On the other hand, so far, as uniformity and stability in the
administration of executive duties are desirable, they are in some measure
secured by the more permanent tenure of office of the senate, which will
check too hasty a departure from the old system, by a change of the
executive, or representative branch of the government.

  § 1433.
 </b>
 Whether tile period of four years will answer all the
purposes,
for which the executive department is established, so as to give it at once
energy and safety, and to preserve a due balance in the administration of
the government, is a problem, which can be solved only by experience.  That
it will contribute far more, than a shorter period, towards these objects,
and thus have a material influence upon the spirit and character of the
government, may be safely affirmed.
 <sup>
  <a href="#48">
   48
  </a>
 </sup>
 Between the commencement and
termination of the period of office, there will be a considerable interval,
at once to justify some independence of opinion and action, and some
reasonable belief, that the propriety of the measures adopted during the
administration may be seen, and felt by the community at large.  The
executive need not be intimidated in his course by the dread of an
immediate loss of public confidence, without the power of regaining it
before a new election; and he may, with some confidence, look forward to
that esteem and respect. of his fellow-citizens, which public services
usually obtain, when they are faithfully and firmly pursued with an honest
devotion to the public good. If he should be re-elected, he will still more
extensively possess the means of carrying into effect a wise and beneficent
system of policy, foreign as well as domestic.  And if he should be
compelled to retire, he cannot but have the consciousness, that measures,
long enough pursued to be found useful, will be persevered in; or, if
abandoned, the contrast will reflect
</p>
<p>
 new honour upon the past administration of the government, and perhaps
reinstate him in office.  At all events, the period is not long enough to
justify any alarms for the pubic safety.
 <sup>
  <a href="#49">

 </sup>
 The danger is not, that such a
limited executive will become an absolute dictator; but, that he may be
overwhelmed by the combined operations of popular influence and legislative
power.  It may be reasonably doubted, from the limited duration of this
office, whether, in point of independence and firmness, he will not be
found unequal to the task, which the constitution assigns him; and if such
a doubt may be indulged, that alone will be decisive against any just
.jealousy of his encroachments.

 Even in England, where an hereditary
monarch with vast prerogatives and patronage exists, it has been found,
that the house of commons, from their immediate sympathy with the people,
and their possession of the purse-strings of the nation, have been able
effectually to check all his usurpations, and to diminish his influence.
Nay, from small beginnings they have risen to be the great power in the
state, counterpoising not only the authority of the crown, but the rank and
wealth of the nobility; and gaining so solid an accession of influence,
that they rather lead, than follow, the great measures of the
administration.

  § 1434.
 </b>
 In comparing the duration of office of the president
with that of
the state executives, additional reasons will present themselves in favour
of the former. At the time of the adoption of the constitution, the
executive was chosen annually in some of the states; in others, biennially;
and in others, triennially. In some
</p>
<p>
 of the states, Which have been subsequently admitted into the Union, the
executive is chosen annually;in others, biennially; in others, triennially;
and in others, quadriennially.  So that there is a great diversity of
opinion exhibited on the subject, not only in the early, but in the later
state constitutions in the Union.
 <sup>
  <a href="#52">
   52
  </a>
 </sup>
 Now, it may be affirmed, that if,
considering the nature of executive duties in the state governments, a
period of office of two, or three, or even four years, has not been found
either dangerous or inconvenient, there are very strong reasons, why the
duration of office of the president of the United States should be at least
equal to the longest of these periods.  The nature of the duties to be
performed by the president, both at home and abroad, are so various and
complicated, as not only to require great talents, and great wisdom to
perform them in any manner suitable to their importance and difficulty; but
also long experience in office to acquire, what may be deemed the habits of
administration, and a steadiness, as well as comprehensiveness, of view of
all the bearings of measures.  The executive duties in the states are few,
and confined to a narrow range.  Those of the president embrace all the
ordinary and extraordinary arrangements of peace and war, of diplomacy and
negotiation, of finance, of naval and military operations, and of the
execution of the laws through almost infinite ramifications of details, and
in places at vast distances from each other.
 <sup>
  <a href="#53">
   53
  </a>
 </sup>
 He is compelled constantly
to take into view the whole circuit of the Union; and to master many of the
local interests and other circumstances, which may require new adaptations
of measures to meet
</p>
<p>
 the public exigences.  Considerable time must necessarily elapse before the
requisite knowledge for the proper discharge of all the functions of his
office can be obtained; and, after it is obtained, time must be allowed to
enable him to act upon that knowledge so, as to give vigour and healthiness
to the operations of the government.  A short term of office would scarcely
suffice, either for suitable knowledge, or suitable action. And to say the
least, four years employed in the executive functions of the Union would
not enable any man to become more familiar with them, than half that period
with those of a single state.
 <sup>
  <a href="#54">
   54
  </a>
 </sup>
 In short, the same general considerations,
which require and justify a prolongation of the period of service of the
members of the national legislature beyond that of the members of the state
legislatures, apply with full force to the executive department.  There
have, nevertheless, at different periods of the government, been found able
and ingenious minds, who have contended for an annual election of the
president, or some shorter period, than four years.
 <sup>
  <a href="#55">
   55

 </sup>
 <b>
  § 1435.
 </b>
 Hitherto our experience has demonstrated, that the
period has not
been found practically so long, as to create danger to the people, or so
short, as to take away a reasonable independence and energy from the
executive.  Still it cannot be disguised, that sufficient
</p>
<p>
 time has scarcely yet elapsed to enable us to pronounce a decisive opinion
upon the subject; since the executive has generally acted witha majority
of the nation; and in critical times has been sustained by the force of
that majority in strong measures, and in times of more tranquillity, by the
general moderation of the policy of his administration.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1436.
 </b>
 Another question, connected with the duration of
office of the
president, was much agitated in the convention, and has often since been a
topic of serious discussion; and that is, whether he should be re-eligible
to office.  In support of the opinion, that the president ought to be
ineligible after one period of office, it was urged, that the return of
public officers into the mass of the common people, where they would feel
the tone, which they had given to the administration of the laws, was the
best security the public could have for their good behaviour.  It would
operate as a check upon the restlessness of ambition, and at the same time
promote the independence of the executive.  It would prevent him from a
cringing subserviency to procure a re-election; or to a resort to corrupt
intrigues for the maintenance of his power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#56">
   56
  </a>
 </sup>
 And it was even added by some,
whose imaginations were continually haunted by terrors of all sorts from
the existence of any powers in the national government, that the
re-eligibility of the executive would furnish an inducement to foreign
governments to interfere in our elections, and would thus inflict upon us
all the evils, which had desolated, and betrayed Poland.
 <sup>
  <a href="#57">
   57

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1437.
 </b>
 In opposition to these suggestions it was stated, that one ill
effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the inducements to good
behaviour. There are few men, who would not feel much less zeal in the
discharge of a duty, when they were conscious, that the advantage of the
station, with which it is connected, must be relinquished at a determinate
period, than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining by
their merit a continuance of it.  A desire of reward is one of the
strongest incentives of human conduct; and the best security for the
fidelity of mankind is to make interest coincide with duty. Even the love
of fame, the ruling passion of the noblest minds, will scarcely prompt a
man to undertake extensive and arduous enterprises, requiring considerable
time to mature and perfect, if they may be taken from his management before
their accomplishment, or be liable to failure in the hands of a successor.
The most, under such circumstances, which can be expected of the generality
of mankind, is the negative merit of not doing harm, instead of the
positive merit of doing good.
 <sup>
  <a href="#58">
   58
  </a>
 </sup>
 Another ill effect of the exclusion would be
the temptation to sordid views, to peculation, to the corrupt gratification
of favourites, and in some instances to usurpation.  A selfish or
avaricious executive might, under such circumstances, be disposed to make
the most he could for himself, and his friends, and partisans, during his
brief continuance in office, and to introduce a system of official
patronage and emoluments, at war with the public interests, but well
adapted to his own. If he were vain and ambitious, as well as avaricious
and selfish, the transient possession of his honours would
</p>
<p>
 depress the former passions, and give new impulses to the latter. He would
dread the loss or gain more, than the loss of fame; since the power must
drop from his hands too soon to ensure any substantial addition to his
reputation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#59">
   59
  </a>
 </sup>
 On the other hand, his very ambition, as well as his avarice,
might tempt him to usurpation; since the chance or impeachment would
scarcely be worthy of thought; and the present power or serving friends
might easily surround him with advocates for every stretch of authority,
which would flatter his vanity, or administer to their necessities.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1438.
 </b>
 Another ill effect of the exclusion would be depriving the
community of the advantage or the experience, gained by an able chief
magistrate in the exercise of office.  Experience is the parent of wisdom.
And it would seem almost absurd to say, that it ought systematically to be
excluded from the executive office. It would be equivalent to banishing
merit from the public councils, because it had been tried.  What could be
more strange, than to declare, at the moment, when wisdom was acquired,
that the possessor of it should no longer be enabled to use it for the very
purposes, for which it was acquired?
 <sup>
  <a href="#60">
   60
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1439.
 </b>
 Another ill effect o.f the exclusion would be, that it
might
banish men from the station in certain emergencies, in which their services
might be eminently useful, and indeed almost indispensable lot the safety
of their country.  There is no nation, which has not at some period or
other in its history felt an absolute necessity of the services of
particular men in particular stations; and perhaps it is not too much to
say, as vital to the preservation or its political exist-
</p>
<p>
 ence. In a time of war, or other pressing calamity, the very confidence of
a nation in the tried integrity and ability of a single man may of itself
ensure a triumph. Is it wise to substitute in such cases inexperience. for
experience, and to set afloat public opinion, and change the settled course
of administration?
 <sup>
  <a href="#61">
   61
  </a>
 </sup>
 One should suppose, that it would be sufficient to
possess the right to change a bad magistrate, without making the singular
merit of a good one the very ground of excluding him from office.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1440.
 </b>
 Another ground against the exclusion was founded upon
our own
experience under the state governments of the utility and safety of the
re-eligibility of the executive.  In some of the states the executive is
re-eligible; in others he is not. But no person has been able to point out
any circumstance in the administration of the state governments
unfavourable to a re-election of the chief magistrate, where the right has
constitutionally existed.  If there had been any practical evil, it must
have been seen and felt.  And the common practice of continuing the
executive in office in some of these states, and of displacing in others,
demonstrates, that the people are not sensible of any abuse, and use their
power with a firm and unembarrassed freedom at the elections.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1441.
 </b>
 It was added, that the advantages proposed by the
exclusion, (1.)
greater independence in the executive, (2.) greater security to the people,
were not well founded.  The former could not be attained in any moderate
degree, unless the exclusion was made perpetual.  And, if it were, there
might be many motives to induce the executive to sacrifice his indepen-
</p>
<p>
 dence to friends, to partisans, to selfish objects, and private gain, to
the fear of enemies, and the desire to stand well with majorities.  As to
the latter supposed advantage, the exclusion would operate no check upon a
man of irregular ambition, or corrupt principles, and against such men
alone could the exclusion be important.  In truth, such men would easily
find means to cover up their usurpations and dishonesty under fair
pretensions, and mean subserviency to popular prejudices.  They would
easily delude the people into a belief, that their acts were
constitutional, because they were in harmony with the public wishes, or
held out some specious, but false projects for the public good.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1449.
 </b>
 Most of this reasoning would apply, though with
diminished force,
to the exclusion for a limited period, or until after the lapse of an
intermediate election to the office.  And it would have equally diminished
advantages, with respect both to personal independence, and public
security. In short, the exclusion, whether. perpetual or temporary, would
have nearly the same effects; and these effects would be generally
pernicious, rather than salutary.
 <sup>
  <a href="#62">
   62
  </a>
 </sup>
 Re-eligibility naturally connects
itself to a certain extent with duration of office.  The latter is
necessary to give the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to
act his part well, and the community time and leisure to observe the
tendency of his measures, and thence to form an experimental estimate of
his merits.  The former is necessary to enable the people, when they see
reason to approve of his conduct, to continue him in the station, in order
to prolong the utility of his virtues and
</p>
<p>
 talents, and to secure to the government the advantage of permanence in a
wise system of administration.
 <sup>
  <a href="#63">
   63

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1443.
 </b>
 Stiff it must be confessed, that where the duration is
for a
considerable length of time, the right of re-election becomes less
important, and perhaps less safe to the public.  A president chosen for ten
years might be made ineligible with far less impropriety, than one chosen
for four years.  And a president chosen for twenty years ought not to be
again eligible, upon the plain ground, that by such a term of office his
responsibility would be greatly diminished, and his means of influence and
patronage immensely increased, so as to check in a great measure the just
expression of public opinion, and the free exercise of the elective
franchise.  Whether an intermediate period, say of eight years, or of seven
years, as proposed in the convention, might not be beneficially combined
with subsequent ineligibility, is a point, upon which great statesmen have
not been agreed; and must be left to the wisdom of future legislators to
weigh anti decide.
 <sup>
  <a href="#64">
   64

 </sup>
 The
</p>
<p>
 inconvenience of such frequently recurring elections of the chief
magistrate, by generating factions, combining intrigues, and agitating the
public mind, seems not hitherto to have attracted as much attention, as it
deserves.  One of two evils may possibly occur from this source; either a
constant state of excitement, which will prevent the fair operation of the
measures of an administration; or a growing indifference to the election,
both on the part of candidates and the people, which will surrender it
practically into the hands of the selfish, the office-seekers, and the
unprincipled devotees of power.  It has been justly remarked by Mr.
Chancellor Kent, that the election of a supreme executive magistrate for a
whole nation affects so many interests, addresses itself so strongly to
popular passions, and holds out such powerful temptations to ambition, that
it necessarily becomes a strong trial to public virtue, and even hazardous
to the public tranquillity.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1444.
 </b>
 The remaining part of the clause respects the
Vice-President.  If
such an officer was to be created, it is plain, that the duration of his
office should be co-extensive with that of the president.  Indeed, as we
shall immediately see, the scheme of the government necessarily embraced
it; for when it was decided, that two persons were to be voted for, as
president, it was decided, that he, who had the greatest number of
</p>
<p>
 votes of the electors, after the person chosen as president, should be
vice-president. The principal question, therefore, was, whether such an
officer ought to be created.  It has been already stated, that the original
scheme of the government did not provide for such an officer.  By that
scheme, the president was to be chosen by the national legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#66">
   66
  </a>
 </sup>
 When
afterwards an election by electors, chosen directly or indirectly by the
people, was proposed by a select committee, the choice of a vice-president
constituted a part of the .proposition; and it was finally adopted by the
vote of ten states against one.
 <sup>
  <a href="#67">
   67
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1445.
 </b>
 The appointment of a vice-president was objected to, as
unnecessary and dangerous.  As president of the senate, he would be
entrusted with a power to control the proceedings of that body; and as he
must come from some one of the states, that state would have a double vote
in the body.  Besides, it was said, that if the president should die, or be
removed, the vice-president might,' by his influence, prevent the election
of a president.  But, at all events, he was a superfluous officer, having
few duties to perform, and those might properly devolve upon some other
established officer of the government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#68">
   68
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1446.
 </b>
 The reasons in favour of the appointment were, in
part, founded
upon the same ground as the objections.  It was seen, that a presiding
officer must be chosen for the senate, where all the states were equally
represented, and where an extreme jealousy might naturally be presumed to
exist of the preponder-
</p>
<p>
 ating influence of any one state.  If a member of the senate were
appointed, either the state would be deprived of one vote, or would enjoy a
double vote in case of an equality of votes, or there Would be a tie, and
no decision.  Each of these alternatives was equally undesirable, and might
lay the foundation of great practical inconveniences.  An officer,
therefore, chosen by the whole Union, would be a more suitable person to
preside, and give a casting vote, since he would be more free, than any
member of the senate, from local attachments, and local interests; and
being the representative of the Union; would naturally be induced to
consult the interests of all the states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#69">
   69
  </a>
 </sup>
 Having only a casting vote, his
influence could only operate exactly, when most beneficial; that is, to
procure a decision.  A still more important consideration is the necessity
of providing some suitable person to perform the executive functions, when
the president is unable to perform them, or is removed from office.  Every
reason, which recommends the mode of election of the president, prescribed
by the constitution, with a view either to dignity, independence, or
personal qualifications for office, applies with equal force to the
appointment of his substitute.  He is to perform the same duties, and to
possess the same rights; and it seems, if not indispensable, at least
peculiarly proper, that the choice of the person, who should succeed to the
executive functions, should belong to the people at large, rather than to a
select body chosen for another purpose.  If (as was suggested) the
president of the senate, chosen by that body, might have been designated,
as the constitutional substitute; it is
</p>
<p>
 by no means certain, that he would either possess, so high qualifications,
or enjoy so much public confidence, or feel so much responsibility for his
conduct, as a vicepresident selected directly by and from the people. The
president of the senate would generally be selected from other motives, and
with reference to other qualifications, than what ordinarily belonged to
the executive department.  His political opinions might be in marked
contrast with those of a majority of the nation; and while he might possess
a just influence in the senate, as a presiding officer, he might be deemed
wholly unfit for the various duties of the chief executive magistrate.  In
addition to these considerations, there was no novelty in the appointment
of such an officer for similar purposes in some of the state governments;
 <sup>
  <a href="#70">
   70
  </a>
 </sup>
 and it therefore came recommended by experience, as a safe and useful
arrangement, to guard the people against the inconveniences of an
interregnum in the government, or a devolution of power upon an officer,
who was not their choice, and might not possess their confidence.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1447.
 </b>
 The next clause embraces the mode of election of the
President and
Vice-President; and although it has been repealed by an amendment of the
constitution, (as will be hereafter shown,) yet it still deserves
consideration, as a part of the original scheme, and more especially, as
very grave doubts have been entertained, whether the substitute is not
inferior in wisdom and convenience.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1448.
 </b>
 The clause is as follows: "Each state shall appoint in such
manner, as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal
to the
</p>
<p>
 whole number of senators and representatives, to which the state may be
entitled in the congress.  But no senator, or representative, or person
holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be
appointed an elector."
</p>
<p>
 "The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot
for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the
same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons
voted for, and of the number of votes for each, which list they shall sign
and certify, and transmit, sealed, to the seat of tim government of the
United States, directed to the president of the senate.  The president of
the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of
representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be
counted.  The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the
president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors
appointed; and if there be more than one, who have such majority and have
an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall
immediately choose by ballot one of them for president; and if no person
have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said house
shall in like manner choose the president.  But in choosing the president,
the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state
having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or
members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states
shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the
president, the person having the greatest number of votes of tim electors
shall be the vice-president.  But if there should remain two or more, who
have equal votes,
</p>
<p>
 the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vicepresident."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1449.
 </b>
 It has been already remarked, that originally in the
convention
the choice of the president was, by a vote of eight states against two,
given to the national legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#71">
   71
  </a>
 </sup>
 This mode of appointment, however,
does not seem to have been satisfactory; for a short time afterwards, upon
a reconsideration of the subject, it was voted, by six states against
three, one being divided, that the president should be chosen by electors
appointed for that purpose; and by eight states against two, that the
electors should be chosen by the legislatures of the states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#72">
   72
  </a>
 </sup>
 Upon a
subsequent discussion, by the vote of seven states against four, the choice
was restored to the national legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#73">
   73
  </a>
 </sup>
 Towards the close of the
convention the subject was referred to a committee, who reported a scheme,
in many respects, as it now stands.  The clause, as to the mode of choice
by electors, was carried, by the vote of nine states against two; that
respecting the time, and place, and manner of voting of the electors, by
ten states against one; that respecting the choice by the house of
representatives, in case no choice was made by the people, by ten states
against
one.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1450.
 </b>
 One motive, which induced a change of the choice of
the president
from the national legislature, unquestionably was, to have the sense of the
people
</p>
<p>
 operate in the choice of the person, to whom so important a trust was
confided.  This would be accomplished much more perfectly by committing the
right of choice to persons, selected for that sole. purpose at the
particular conjuncture, instead of persons, selected for the general
purposes of legislation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#75">
   75
  </a>
 </sup>
 Another motive was, to escape from those
intrigues and cabals, which would be promoted in the legislative body by
artful and designing men, long before the period of the choice, with a view
to accomplish their own selfish purposes.
 <sup>
  <a href="#76">
   76
  </a>
 </sup>
 The very circumstance, that the
body entrusted with the power, was chosen long before the presidential
election, and for other general functions, would facilitate every plan to
corrupt, or manage them.  It would be in the power of an ambitious
candidate, by holding out the rewards of office, or other sources of
patronage and honour, silently; but irresistibly to influence a majority of
votes; and, thus, by his own bold and unprincipled conduct, to secure a
choice, to the exclusion of the highest, and purest, and most enlightened
men in the country.  Besides; the very circumstance of the possession of
the elective power would mingle itself with all the ordinary measures of
legislation.  Compromises and bargains would be made, and laws passed, to
gratify particular members, or conciliate particular interests; and thus a
disastrous influence would be shed over the whole policy of the government.
The president would, in fact, become the mere tool of the dominant party
in congress; and would, before he occupied the seat, be bound down to an
entire subserviency to their views.
 <sup>
  <a href="#77">
   77
  </a>
 </sup>
 No measure would be adopted, which
</p>
<p>
 was not, in some degree, connected with the presidential election; and no
presidential election made, but what would depend upon artificial
combinations, and a degrading favouritism.
 <sup>
  <a href="#78">
   78
  </a>
 </sup>
 There would be ample room for
the same course of intrigues, which has made memorable the choice of a king
in the Polish diet, of a chief in the Venetian senate, and of a pope in the
sacred college of the Vatican.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1451.
 </b>
 Assuming that the choice ought not to be confided to
the national
legislature, there remained various other modes, by which it might be
effected; by the people directly; by the state legislatures; or by
electors, chosen by the one, or the other.  The latter mode was deemed most
advisable; and the reasoning, by which it was supported, was to the
following effect.  The immediate election should be made by men, the most
capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under
circumstances favourable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of
all the inducements, which ought to govern their choice.  A small number of
persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass for this
special object, would be most likely to possess the information, and
discernment, and independence, essential for the proper discharge of the
duty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#79">
   79
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is also highly important to afford as little opportunity, as
possible, to tumult and disorder. These evils are not unlikely to occur in
the election of a chief magistrate directly by the people, considering the
strong excitements and interests, which such an occasion may naturally be
presumed to produce.  The choice of a number of persons, to
</p>
<p>
 form an intermediate body of electors, would be far less apt to convulse
the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice
of one, who was himself the final object of the public wishes. And as the
electors chosen in each state are to assemble, and vote in the state, in
which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation would expose
them much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them
to the people, than if they were all convened at one time in one place.
 <sup>
  <a href="#80">
   80
  </a>
 </sup>
 The same circumstances would naturally lessen the dangers of cabal,
intrigue, and corruption, especially, if congress should, as they
undoubtedly would, prescribe the same day for the choice of the electors,
and for giving their votes throughout the United States.  The scheme,
indeed, presents every reasonable guard against these fatal evils to
republican governments.  The appointment of the president is not made to
depend upon any pre-existing body of men, who might be tampered with
beforehand to prostitute their votes; but is delegated to persons chosen by
the immediate act of the people, for that sole and temporary purpose.  All
those persons, who, from their situation, might be suspected of-too great a
devotion to the president in office, such as senators, and representatives,
and other persons holding offices of trust or profit under the United
States, are excluded from eligibility to the trust. Thus, without
corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election may
be fairly presumed to enter upon their duty free from any sinister bias.
Their transitory existence, and dispersed situation would present
formidable obstacles to any corrupt combinations; and
</p>
<p>
 time, as well as means, would be wanting to accomplish, by bribery or
intrigue of any considerable number, a betrayal of their duty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#81">
   81
  </a>
 </sup>
 The
president, too, who should be thus appointed, would be far more
independent, than if chosen by a legislative body, to whom he might be
expected to make correspondent sacrifices, to gratify their wishes, or
reward their services.
 <sup>
  <a href="#82">
   82
  </a>
 </sup>
 And on the other hand, being chosen by the voice
of the people, his .gratitude would take the natural direction, and
sedulously guard their rights.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1452.
 </b>
 The other parts of the scheme are no less entitled to
commendation.  The number of electors is equal to the number of senators
and representatives of each state; thus giving to each state as virtual a
representation in the electoral colleges, as that, which it enjoys in
congress.  The votes, when given, are to be transmitted to the seat of the
national government, and there opened and counted in the presence of both
houses.  The person, having a majority of the whole number of votes, is to
be president.  But, if no one of the candidates has such a majority, then
the house of representatives, the popular branch of the government, is to
elect from the five highest on the list the person, whom they may deem best
qualified for the office, each state having one vote in the choice.  The
person, who has the next highest number of votes after the choice of
president, is to be vice-president.  But, if two or more shall have equal
votes, the senate are to choose the vice-president.  Thus, the ultimate
functions are to be shared alternately by the senate and representatives in
the organization of the executive department.

 "This process of election," adds the Federalist, with a
	somewhat
elevated tone of satisfaction, "affords a moral certainty, that the office
of president will seldom fall to the lot of a man, who is not in an eminent
degree endowed with the requisite qualifica-
</p>
<p>
 tions.  Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may
alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honours of a single state.  But
it will require other talents, and a different kind of merit to establish
him in the esteem, and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable
a portion of it, as will be necessary to make him a successful candidate
for the distinguished office of president of the United States.  It will
not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant probability of
seeing the station filled by characters preeminent for ability and virtue.
And this will be thought
no inconsiderable recommendation of the constitution by those, who are able
to estimate the share, which the executive in every government must
necessarily have in its good or ill administration."

 The mode of election of the president thus provided
for has not
wholly escaped censure, though the objections have been less numerous, than
those brought against many other parts of the constitution, touching that
department of the government.

 One objection was, that he is not chosen directly by
the people,
so as to secure a proper dependence upon them.  And in support of this
objection it has been urged, that he will in fact owe his appointment to
the state governments; for it will become the policy of the states, which
cannot directly elect a president, to prevent his election by the people,
and thus to throw the choice into the house of representatives, where it
will be decided by the votes of states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#87">
   87
  </a>
 </sup>
 Again, it was urged, that, this
very mode of choice by states in the house of representatives is most
unjust
</p>
<p>
 and unequal.  Why, it has been said, should Delaware, with her single
representative, possess the same vote with Virginia, with ten times that
number?
 <sup>
  <a href="#88">
   88
  </a>
 </sup>
 Besides; this mode of choice by the house of representatives will
give rise to the worst intrigues; and if ever the arts of corruption shall
prevail in the choice of a president, they will prevail by first throwing
the choice into the house of representatives, and then assailing the
virtue, and independence of members holding the state vote, by all those
motives of honour and reward, which can so easily be applied by a bold and
ambitious candidate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#89">

  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1456.
 </b>
 The answer to these objections has been already in a
great measure
anticipated in the preceding pages.  But it was added, that the devolution
of the choice upon the house of representatives was inevitable, if there
should be no choice by the people; and it could not be denied, that it was
a more appropriate body for this purpose, than the senate, seeing, that the
latter were chosen by the state legislatures, and the former by the people.
Besides; the connexion of the senate with the executive department might
naturally produce a strong influence in favour of the existing executive,
in opposition to any rival candidate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#90">
   90
  </a>
 </sup>
 The mode of voting by states, if
the choice came to the house of representatives, was but a just
compensation to the smaller states for their loss in the primary election.
When the people vote for the president, it is manifest, that the large
states enjoy a decided advantage over the small states; and thus their
interests may be neglected or sacrificed.  To compensate them for this in
the eventual election by the house of represen-
</p>
<p>
 tatives, a correspondent advantage is given to the small states.  It was in
fact a compromise.
 <sup>
  <a href="#91">
   91
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is no injustice in this; and if the people do
not elect a president, there is a greater chance of electing one in this
mode, than there would be by a mere representative vote according to
numbers; as the same divisions would probably exist in the popular branch,
as in their respective states.

<p>
 <b>
  § 1457.
 </b>
 It has been observed with much point, that in no
respect have the
enlarged and liberal views of the framers of the constitution, and the
expectations of the public, when it was adopted, been so completely
frustrated, as in the practical operation of the system, so far as relates
to the independence of the electors in the electoral colleges.
 <sup>
  <a href="#93">
   93
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is
notorious, that the electors are now chosen wholly with reference to
particular candidates, and are silently pledged to vote for them. Nay, upon
some occasions the electors publicly pledge themselves to vote for a
particular person; and thus, in effect, the whole foundation of the system,
so elaborately constructed, is subverted.
 <sup>
  <a href="#94">
   94
  </a>
 </sup>
 The candidates for the
presidency are selected and announced in each state long before the
election; and an ardent canvass is maintained in the newspapers, in party
meetings, and in the state legislatures, to secure votes for the favourite
candidate, and to defeat his opponents.  Nay, the state legislatures often
become the nominating body, acting in their official capacities, and
recommending by solemn resolves their own candidate to the other states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#95">
   95
  </a>
 </sup>
 So, that nothing is left to the electors after their choice,
</p>
<p>
 but to register votes, which are already pledged; and an exercise of an
independent judgment would be treated, as a political usurpation,
dishonourable to the individual, and a fraud upon his constituents.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1458.
 </b>
 The principal difficulty, which has been felt in the
mode of
election, is the constant tendency, from the number of candidates, to bring
the choice into the house of representatives.  This has already occurred
twice in the progress of the government; and in the future there is every
probability of a far more frequent occurrence.  This was early foreseen;
and, even in one of the state conventions, a most distinguished statesman,
and one of the framers of the constitution, admitted, that it would
probably be found impracticable to elect a president by the immediate
suffrages of the people; and that in so large a country many persons would
probably be voted for, and that the lowest of the five highest on the list
might not have an inconsiderable number of votes.
 <sup>
  <a href="#96">
   96
  </a>
 </sup>
 It cannot escape the
discernment of any attentive observer, that if the house of representatives
is often to choose a president, the choice will, or at least may, be
influenced by many motives, independent of his merits and qualifications.
There is danger, that intrigue and cabal may mix in the rivalries and
strife.
 <sup>
  <a href="#97">
   97
  </a>
 </sup>
 And the discords, if not the corruptions, generated by the
occasion, will probably long outlive the immediate choice, and scatter
their pestilential influences over all the great interests of the country.
One fearful crisis was passed in the choice
</p>
<p>
 of Mr. Jefferson over his competitor, Mr. Burr, in 1801, which threatened a
dissolution of the government, and put the issue upon the tried patriotism
of one or two individuals, who yielded from a sense of duty their
preference of the candidate, generally supported by their friends.

 Struck with these difficulties, it has been a
favourite opinion of
many distinguished statesmen, especially of late years, that the choice
ought to be directly by the people in representative districts, a measure,
which, it has been supposed, would at once facilitate a choice by the
people in the first instance, and interpose an insuperable barrier to any
general corruption or intrigue in the election.  Hitherto this plan has not
possessed extensive public favour.  Its merits are proper for discussion
elsewhere, and do not belong to these Commentaries.

 <b>
  § 1460.
 </b>
 The issue of the contest of 1801 gave rise
</p>
<p>
 to an amendment of the constitution in several respects, materially
changing the mode of election of president. In the first place it provides,
that the ballots of the electors shall be separately given for president
and vicepresident, instead of one ballot for two persons, as president;
that the vice-president (like the president) shall he chosen by a majority
of the whole number of electors appointed; that the number of candidates,
out of whom the selection of president is to be made by the house of
representatives, shall be three, instead of five; that the senate shall
choose the vice-president from the two highest numbers on the list; and
that, if no choice is made of president before the fourth of March
following, the vice-president shall act as president.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1461.
 </b>
 The amendment was proposed in October, 1803, and was
ratified
before September, 1804,
 <sup>
  <a href="#99">
   99
  </a>
 </sup>
 and is in the following terms.
</p>
<p>
 "The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot
for president and vice-president, one of whom, at least, shall not be an
inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their
ballots the person voted for as president, and in distinct ballots the
person voted for as vice-president; and they shall make distinct lists of
all persons voted. for as president, and of all persons voted for as
vicepresident, and of the number of votes for each; which lists they shall
sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of government of the
United States; directed to the president of the senate; -- the president of
the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of
representatives, open all the certificates,
</p>
<p>
 and the votes shall then be counted; the person having the greatest number
of votes for president shall be the president, if such number be a majority
of the whole number of electors appointed; and if no person have such
majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers, not exceeding
three, on the list of those voted for as president, the house of
representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the president.  But in
choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the
representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose
shall consist of a member, or members, from twothirds of the states, and a
majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice.  And if the
house of representatives shall not choose a president, whenever the right
of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next
following, then the vicepresident shall act as president, as in the case of
the death or other constitutional disability of the president."
</p>
<p>
 "The person, having the greatest number of votes as vice-president, shall
be the vice-president, if such number be a majority o! the whole number of
electors appointed; and if no person have a majority, then from the two
highest numbers on the list, the senate shall choose the vice-president; a
quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of
senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a
choice."
</p>
<p>
 "But no person, constitutionally ineligible to the office of president,
shall be eligible to that of vicepresident of the United States."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1462.
 </b>
 This amendment has alternately been the subject of
praise and
blame, and experience alone can
</p>
<p>
 decide, whether the changes proposed by it are in all respects for the
better, or the worse.
 <sup>
  <a href="#100">
   100
  </a>
 </sup>
 In some respects it is a substantial improvement.
In the first place, under the original mode, the senate was restrained from
acting, until the house of representatives had made their selection, which,
if parties ran high, might be considerably delayed.  By the amendment the
senate may proceed to a choice of the vice-president, immediately on
ascertaining the returns of the votes.
 <sup>
  <a href="#101">
   101
  </a>
 </sup>
 In the next place, under the
original mode, if no choice should be made of a president by the house of
representatives until after the expiration of the term of the preceding
officer, there would be no person to perform the functions of the office,
and an interregnum would ensue, and a total suspension of the powers of
government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#102">
   102
  </a>
 </sup>
 By the amendment, the new vice-president would in such case
act as president.  By the original mode, the senate are to elect the
vice-president by ballot; by the amendment, the mode of choice is left
open, so that it may be viva voce.  Whether this be an improvement, or not,
may be doubted.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1463.
 </b>
 On the other hand, the amendment has certainly greatly
diminished
the dignity and importance of the office of vice-president.  Though the
duties remain the same, he is no longer a competitor for the presidency,
and selected, as possessing equal merit, talents, and qualifications, with
the other candidate. As every state was originally compelled to vote for
two candidates (one of whom did not belong to the state)
</p>
<p>
 for the same office, a choice was fairly given to all other states to
select between them; thus excluding the absolute predominance of any local
interest, or local partiality.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1464.
 </b>
 In the original plan, as well as in the amendment, no
provision is
made for the discussion or decision of any questions, which may arise, as
to the regularity and authenticity of the returns of the electoral votes,
or the right of the persons, who gave the votes, or the manner, or
circumstances, in which they ought to be counted.  It seems to have been
taken for granted, that no question could ever arise on the subject; and
that nothing more was necessary, than to open the certificates, which were
produced, in the presence of both houses, and to count the names and
numbers, as returned.  Yet it is easily to be conceived, that very delicate
and interesting inquiries may occur, fit to be debated and decided by some
deliberative body.
 <sup>
  <a href="#103">
   103
  </a>
 </sup>
 In fact, a question did occur upon the counting of the
votes for the presidency in 1821 upon the re-election of Mr. Monroe,
whether the votes of the state of Missouri could be counted; but as the
count would make no difference in the choice, and the declaration was made
of his re-election, the senate immediately withdrew; and the jurisdiction,
as well as the course of proceeding in a case of real controversy, was left
in a most embarrassing situation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1465.
 </b>
 Another defect in the constitution is, that no
provision was
originally, or is now made, for a case, where there is an equality of votes
by the electors for more persons, than the constitutional number, from
which the house of representatives is to make the election.  The language
of the original text is, that
</p>
<p>
 the house shall elect "from the five highest on the list." Suppose there
were six candidates, three of whom had an equal number; who are to be
preferred?  The amendment is, that the house shall elect "from the persons
having the highest numbers, not exceeding three."  Suppose there should be
four candidates, two of whom should have an equality of votes; who are to
be preferred?  Such a case is quite within the range of probability; and
may hereafter occasion very serious dissensions.  One object in lessening
the number of the persons to be balloted for from five to three, doubtless
was, to take away the chance of any person few votes from being chosen
president having very against the general sense of the nation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#104">
   104
  </a>
 </sup>
 Yet it is
obvious now, that a person having but a very small number of electoral
votes, might, under the present plan, be chosen president, if the other
votes were divided between two eminent rival candidates; the friends of
each of whom might prefer any other to such rival candidate.  Nay, their
very hostility to each other might combine them in a common struggle to
throw the final choice upon the third candidate, whom they might hope to
control, or fear to disoblige.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1466.
 </b>
 It is observable, that the language of the constitution is, that
"each state shall appoint in such manner, as the legislature thereof may
direct," the number of electors, to which the state is entitled. Under this
authority the appointment of electors has been variously provided for by
the state legislatures.  In some states the legislature have directly
chosen the electors by themselves; in others they have been chosen by the
people by a general ticket throughout the whole state; and in others by the
people in electoral
</p>
<p>
 districts, fixed by the legislature, a certain number of electors being
apportioned to each district.
 <sup>
  <a href="#105">
   105
  </a>
 </sup>
 No question has ever arisen, as to the
constitutionality of either mode, except that of a direct choice by the
legislature. But this, though often doubted by able and ingenious minds,
 <sup>
  <a href="#106">
   106
  </a>
 </sup>
 has been firmly established in practice, ever since the adoption of the
constitution, and does not now seem to admit of controversy, even if a
suitable tribunal existed to adjudicate upon it.
 <sup>
  <a href="#107">
   107
  </a>
 </sup>
 At present, in nearly
all the states, the electors are chosen either by the people by a general
ticket, or by the state. legislature.  The choice in districts has been
gradually abandoned; and is now persevered in, but by two states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#108">
   108
  </a>
 </sup>
 The
inequality of this mode of choice, unless it should become general
throughout the Union, is so obvious, that it is rather matter of surprise,
that it should not long since have been wholly abandoned. In case of any
party divisions in a state, it may neutralize its whole vote, while all the
other states give an unbroken electoral vote.  On this account, and for the
sake of uniformity, it has been thought desirable by many statesmen to have
the constitution amended so, as to provide for an uniform mode of choice by
the people.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1467.
 </b>
 The remaining part of the clause, which precludes any
senator,
representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the
United States, from being an elector, has been already alluded to, and.
requires little comment.  The object is, to prevent persons holding public
stations under the government of the United States, from any direct
influence in the
</p>
<p>
 choice of a president.  In respect to persons holding office, it is
reasonable to suppose, that their partialities would all be in favour of
the re-election of the actual incumbent, and they might have strong
inducements to exert their official influence in the electoral college. In
respect to senators and representatives, there is this additional reason
for excluding them; that they would be already committed by their vote in
the electoral college; and thus, if there should be no election by the
people, they could not bring to the final vote either the impartiality, or
the independence, which the theory of the constitution contemplates.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1468.
 </b>
 The next clause is, "The congress may "determine the
time of
choosing the electors, and the day, on which they shall give their votes,
which day shall be the same throughout the United States."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1469.

 The propriety of this power would seem to be almost
self-evident.
Every reason of public policy and convenience seems in favour of a fixed
time of giving the electoral votes, and that it should be the same
throughout the Union.  Such a measure is calculated to repress political
intrigues and speculations, by rendering a combination among the electoral
colleges, as to their votes, if not utterly impracticable, at least very
difficult; and thus secures the people against those ready expedients,
which corruption never fails to employ to accomplish its designs.
 <sup>

 The
arts of ambition are thus in some degree checked, and the independence of
the electors against external influence in some degree secured.  This
power, however, did not escape objection in the general, or the state
conventions, though the objection was not extensively insisted on.

  § 1470.
 </b>
 In pursuance of the authority given by this clause,
congress, in
1792, passed an act declaring, that the electors shall be appointed in each
state within thirty-four days, preceding the first Wednesday in December in
ever; fourth year, succeeding the last election of president, according to
the apportionment of representatives and senators then existing,  The
electors chosen are required to meet and give their votes on the said first
Wednesday of December, at such place in each state, as shall be directed by
the legislature thereof.  They are then to make and sign three certificates
of all the votes by them given, and to seal up the same, certifying on
each, that a list of the votes of such state for president and
vice-president is contained therein, and shall appoint a person to take
charge of, and deliver, one of the same certificates to the president of
the senate at the seat of government, before the first Wednesday of January
then next ensuing, another of the certificates is robe forwarded forthwith
by the post-office to the president of the senate at the seat of
government, and the third is to be delivered to the judge of the district,
in which the electors assembled.
 <sup>
  <a href="#111">

 Other auxiliary provisions are made by
the same act for the due transmission and preservation of the electoral
votes, and authenticating the appointment of the electors.  The president's
term of office is also declared to commence on the fourth day of March next
succeeding the day, on which the votes of the electors shall be given.

  § 1471.
 </b>
 The next clause respects the qualifications of the
president of
the United States.  "No person, except a natural born citizen, or a citizen
of the United States at the time of the adoption of this constitution,
shaft be eligible to the office of president.
</p>
<p>
 Neither shall any person be eligible to that office, who shall not have
attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a
resident within the United States."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1472.
 </b>
 Considering the nature of the duties, the extent of the
information, and the solid wisdom and experience required in the executive
department, no one can reasonably doubt the propriety of some qualification
of age.  That, which has been selected, is the middle age of life, by which
period the character and talents of individuals are generally known, and
fully developed; and opportunities have usually been afforded for public
service, and for experience in the public councils.  The faculties of the
mind, if they have not then attained to their highest maturity, are in full
vigour, and hastening towards their ripest state.  The judgment, acting
upon large materials, has, by that time, attained a solid cast; and the
principles, which form the character, and the integrity, which gives lustre
to the virtues of life, must then, if ever, have acquired public confidence
and approbation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#113">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1473.
 </b>
 It is indispensable, too, that the president should be
a natural
born citizen of the United States; or a citizen at the adoption of the
constitution, and for fourteen years before his election. This permission
of a naturalized citizen to become president is an exception from the great
fundamental policy of all governments, to exclude foreign influence from
their executive councils and duties.  It was doubtless introduced (for it
has now become by lapse of time merely nominal, and will soon become wholly
extinct) out of respect to those distinguished revolutionary patriots, who
were born in a foreign land, and yet had entitled themselves
</p>
<p>
 to high honours in their adopted country.
 <sup>
  <a href="#114">
   114
  </a>
 </sup>
 A positive exclusion of them
from the office would have been unjust to their merits, and painful to
their sensibilities. But the general propriety of the exclusion of
foreigners, in common cases, will scarcely be doubted by any sound
statesman.  It cuts off all chances for ambitious foreigners, who might
otherwise be intriguing for the office; and interposes a barrier against
those corrupt interferences of foreign governments in executive elections,
which have inflicted the most serious evils upon the elective monarchies of
Europe.  Germany, Poland, and even the pontificate of Rome, are sad, but
instructive examples of the enduring mischiefs arising from this source.
 <sup>
  <a href="#115">
   115
  </a>
 </sup>
 A residence of fourteen years in the United States is also made an
indispensable requisite for every candidate; so, that the people may have a
full opportunity to know his character and merits, and that he may have
mingled in the duties, and felt the interests, and understood the
principles, and nourished the attachments, belonging to every citizen in a
republican government.
 <sup>
  <a href="#116">

 By "residence," in the constitution, is to be
understood, not an absolute inhabitancy within the United States during the
whole period; but such an inhabitancy, as includes a permanent domicil in
the United States.  No one has supposed, that a temporary absence abroad on
public business, and especially on an embassy to a foreign nation, would
interrupt the residence of a citizen, so as to disqualify him for office.
 <sup>
  <a href="#117">

 </sup>
 If the word were to be construed with such strictness, then a mere journey
through any foreign
</p>
<p>
 adjacent territory for health, or for pleasure, or a commorancy there for a
single day, would amount to a disqualification.  Under such a construction
a military or civil officer, who should have been in Canada during the late
war on public business, would have lost his eligibility.  The true sense of
residence in the constitution is fixed domicil, or being out of the United
States, and settled abroad for the purpose of general inhabitancy, animo
manendi, and not for a mere temporary and fugitive purpose, in transitu.

 <b>
  § 1474.
 </b>
 The next clause is, "In case of the removal of the
president from
office, or his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the duties of
the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president.  And the
congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or
inability of the president and vice-president, declaring what officer shall
then act as president; and such officer shall act accordingly, until the
disability be removed, or a president shall be elected."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1475.
 </b>
 The original scheme of the constitution did not
embrace (as has
been already stated) the appointment of any vice-president, and in case of
the death, resignation, or disability of the president, the president of
the senate was to perform the duties of his office.
 <sup>

shall be no president, then the speaker of the house of representatives for

 <b>
  § 1476.
 </b>
 No provision seems to be made, or at least directly
made, for the
case of the non-election of any president and vice-president at the period
prescribed by the constitution.  The case of a vacancy by removal, death,
or resignation, is expressly provided for; but not of a vacancy by the
expiration of the official term of office.  A learned commentator has
thought, that such a case is not likely to happen, until the people of the
United States shall be weary of the constitution and government, and shall
adopt this method of putting a period to both, a mode of dissolution, which
seems, from its peaceable character, to recommend itself to his mind, as
fit for such a crisis.
 <sup>
  <a href="#121">
   121
  </a>
 </sup>
 But no absolute dissolution of the government
would constitutionally take place by such a non-election.  The only effect
would be, a suspension of the powers of the executive part of the
government, and incidentally of the legislative powers, until a new
election to the presidency should take place at the next constitutional
period, an evil of very great magnitude, but not equal to a positive
extinguishment of the constitution.  But the event of a non-election may
arise, without any intention on the part of the people to dissolve the
government.  Suppose there should
</p>
<p>
 be three candidates for the presidency, and two for the vice-presidency,
each of whom should receive, as nearly as possible, the same number of
votes; which party, under such circumstances, is bound to yield up its own
preference?  May not each feel equally and conscientiously the duty to
support to the end of the contest its own favorite candidate in the house
of representatives? Take another case.  Suppose two persons should receive
a majority of all the votes for the presidency, and both die before the
time of taking office, or even before the votes are ascertained by
congress.  There is nothing incredible in the supposition, that such an
event may occur.  It is not nearly as improbable, as the occurrence of the
death of three persons, who had held the office of president, on the
anniversary of our independence, and two of these in the same year.  In
each of these' cases there would be a vacancy in the office of president
and vice-president by mere efflux of time; and it may admit of doubt,
whether the language of the constitution reaches them.  If the
vice-president should succeed to the office of president, he will continue
in it until the regular expiration of the period, for which the president
was chosen; for there is no provision for the choice of a new president,
except at the regular period, when there is a vice-president in office; and
none for the choice of a vice-president, except when a president also is to
be chosen.

  <a href="#122">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1477.
 </b>
 Congress, however, have undertaken to provide for
every case of a
vacancy both of the offices of president and vice-president; and have
declared, that. in such an event there shall immediately be a new election
made in the manner prescribed by the act.
 <sup>
  <a href="#123">

</p>
<p>
 How far such an exercise of power is constitutional has never yet been
solemnly presented for decision.  The point was hinted at in some of the
debates, when the constitution was adopted; and it was then thought to be
susceptible of some doubt.
 <sup>
  <a href="#124">

 Every sincere friend of the constitution will
naturally feel desirous of upholding the power, as far as he
constitutionally may.
 <sup>
  <a href="#125">

 But it would be more satisfactory, to provide for
the case by some suitable amendment, which should clear away every doubt,
and thus prevent a crisis dangerous to our future peace, if not to the
existence of the government.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1478.
 </b>
 What shall be the proper proof of the resignation of the
president, or vice-president, or of their refusal to accept the office, is
left open by the constitution.  But congress, with great wisdom and
forecast, have provided, that it shall be by some instrument in writing,
declaring the same, subscribed by the party, and delivered into the office
of the secretary of state.
 <sup>

 <b>
  § 1479.
 </b>
 The next clause is,  "The president shall, at stated times,
receive for his services a compensation, which shall neither be increased,
nor diminished during the period, for which he shall have been elected, and
he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United
States, or any of them."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1480.
 </b>
 It is obvious, that without due attention to the
proper support of
the president, the separation
</p>
<p>
 of the executive from the legislative department would be merely nominal
and nugatory. The legislature, with a discretionary power over his salary
and emolument, would soon render him obsequious to their will.  A control
over a man's living is in most cases a control over his actions.  To act
upon any other view of the subject would be to disregard the voice of
experience, and the operation of the invariable principles, which regulate
human conduct.  There are, indeed, men, who could neither be distressed,
nor won into a sacrifice of their duty.  But this stern virtue is the
growth of few soils; and it will be found, that the general lesson of human
life is, that men obey their interests; that they may be driven by poverty
into base compliances, or tempted by largesses to a desertion of duty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#127">
   127
  </a>
 </sup>
 Nor
have there been wanting examples in our own country of the intimidation, or
seduction of the executive by the terrors, or allurements of the pecuniary
arrangements of the legislative body.
 <sup>
  <a href="#128">
   128
  </a>
 </sup>
 The wisdom of this clause can
scarcely be too highly commended. The legislature, on the appointment of a
president, is once for all to declare, what shall be the compensation for
his services during the time, for which he shall have been elected.  This
done, they will have no power to alter it, either by increase or
diminution, till a new period of service by a new election commences.  They
can neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon his necessities, nor
corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice.  Neither the Union, nor
any of its members, will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty
to receive, any other emolument.  He can, of course, have
</p>
<p>
 no pecuniary inducement to renounce, or desert, the independence intended
for him by the constitution.
 <sup>
  <a href="#129">
   129
  </a>
 </sup>
 The salary of the first president was fixed
by congress at the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars per annum, and of
the vice-president, at five thousand dollars.
 <sup>
  <a href="#130">
   130
  </a>
 </sup>
 And to prevent any
difficulty, as to future presidents, congress, by a permanent act, a few
years afterwards established the same compensation for all future
presidents and vice-presidents.
 <sup>
  <a href="#131">
   131
  </a>
 </sup>
 So that, unless some great changes should
intervene, the independence of the executive is permanently secured by an
adequate maintenance; and it can scarcely be diminished, unless some future
executive shall basely betray his duty to his successor.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1481.
 </b>
 The next clause is, "Before he enters on the execution
of his
office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation: I do solemnly
swear, (or affirm,) that I will faithfully execute the office of President
of the United States, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve,
protect, and defend the constitution of the United States."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1489.
 </b>
 There is little need of commentary upon this clause.
No man can
well doubt the propriety of placing a president of the United States under
the most solemn obligations to preserve, protect, and defend the
constitution.  It is a suitable pledge of his fidelity and responsibility
to his country; and creates upon his conscience a deep sense of duty, by an
appeal at once in the presence of God and man to the most sacred and solemn
sanctions, which can operate upon the human mind.

elective chief magistrates.  "The confession of every writer on the subject
of civil government," says be, "the experience of ages, the example of
Poland, and of the Papal Dominions, seem to place this amongst the few
indubitable maxims, Which,the science of government admits of.  A crown is
too splendid a prize to be conferred upon merit. The passions, or interests
of the electors, exclude all consideration of the qualities of the
competitors.  The same observation holds concerning the appointments to any
office, which is attended with a great share of power or emolument.
Nothing is gained by a popular choice worth the dissensions, tumults, and
interruptions of regular industry, with which it is inseparably attended."
(Paley's Moral Philosophy, B. 6, ch. 7, p. 367.)  Mr. Chancellor Kent has
also remarked, that it is a curious fact in European history, that on the
first partition of Poland in 1773, when the partitioning powers thought it
expedient to foster and confirm all the defects of its wretched government,
they sagaciously demanded  of the Polish Diet, that the crown should continue elective.  1 Kent. Comm.

<li><a id="55"></a> Mr. Senator Hillhouse, in April, 1808, proposed an annual election,
among other amendments to the constitution; and defended the proposition in
a very elaborate speech.  The, amendment, however, found no support.  See
Hillhouse's Speech, l2th April, 1808, printed at New Haven, by O. Steele &amp;
Co. The learned editor of Blackstone's Commentaries manifestly thought a
more frequent election, than once in four years, desirable.  1 Tuck. Black.

<li><a id="64"></a> Mr. Jefferson appears to have entertained the opinion strongly, that the
chief magistrate ought to be ineligible after one term of office. "Reason
and experience tell us," says he, "that the chief magistrate will always be
re-elected, if he may be re-elected.  He is then an officer for life. This
once observed, it becomes of so much consequence to certain nations to have
a friend or a foe at the head of our affairs, that they will interfere with
money and with arms, &amp;c.  The election of a president of America some years
hence will he much more interesting to certain nations of Europe, than ever
the election of a king of Poland was." (Letter to Mr. Madison in 1787, 2
Jeffer. Cor. 274, 275.) He added in the same letter: "The power of removing
every fourth year by the vote of the people is a power, which they will not
exercise; and if they were disposed to exercise it, they would not be
permitted."*  How little has this reasoning accorded with the fact!!  In
the memoir written by him towards the close of his life, he says: "My wish
was, that the president * See also 2 Jefferson's Corresp. 291, 439, 440, 443.  should be elected for seven years, and be ineligible afterwards.  This term
I thought sufficient to enable him, with the concurrence of the
legislature, to carry through and establish any system of improvement he
should propose for the general good.  But. the practice adopted, I think,
is better, allowing his continuance for eight years, with a liability to be
dropped at half way of the term, making that a period of probation." 1

<li><a id="83"></a> In addition to these grounds, it has been suggested, that a still
greater and more insuperable difficulty against a choice directly by the
people, as a single community, was, that such a measure would be an entire
consolidation of the government of the country, and an annihilation of the
state sovereignties, so far as concerned the organization of the executive
department of the Union.  This was not to be permitted, or endured; and it
would, besides, have destroyed the balance of the Union, and reduced the
weight of the slave-holding states to a degree, which they would have
deemed altogether inadmissible.  1 Kent's Comm. Lect. 13, p. 261.  It is
not perceived, how either of these results could have taken place, unless
upon some plan, (which was never proposed,) which should disregard
altogether the existence of the states, and take away all representation of
the slave population.  The choice might have been directly by the people
without any such course.  And in point of fact, such an objection, as that
suggested by Mr. Chancellor Kent, to a choice by the people, does not seem
to have occurred to the authors of the Federalist.  If the choice had been
directly by the people, each state having as many votes for president, as
it would be entitled to electors, the result would have been exactly, as it
now is.  If each state had been entitled to one vote, only, then the state
sovereignties would have been completely represented by the people of each
state upon an equality.  If the choice had been by the people in districts,
according to the ratio of representation, then the president would have
been chosen by a majority of the people in a majority of the representative
districts.  There would be no more a consolidation, than there now is in
the house of representatives.  In neither view could there be any injurious
inequality bearing on the Southern states.</li>
<li><a id="84"></a> Mr. Chancellor Kent has summed up the general arguments in favour of an
election by electors with great felicity.  1 Kent's Comm. Lect. 13, p. 261,
262.  And the subject of the organization of the executive department is
also explained, with much clearness and force, by the learned editor of
Blackstone's Commentaries, and by Mr. Rawle in his valuable labours.  1

alarming, is the nomination of the president by members of  congress at political meetings at Washington; thus, in the mild form of
recommendation introducing their votes into the election with all their
official influence.  Rawle on Const. ch. 5, p. 58.</li>

<li><a id="98"></a> Allusion is here especially made to the late Mr. Bayard, who held the
vote of Delaware, and who, by his final vote in favour of Mr. Jefferson,
decided the election.  It was remarked at the time, that in the election of
Mr. Jefferson, in 1801, the votes of two or three states were held by
persons, who soon afterwards received office from him. The circumstance is
spoken of in positive terms by Mr. Bayard, in his celebrated Speech on the
Judiciary, in 1802.*  Mr. Bayard did not make it matter of accusation
against Mr. Jefferson, as founded in corrupt bargaining. Nor has any such
charge been subsequently made.  The fact is here stated merely to show, how
peculiarly delicate the exercise of such functions necessarily is; and how
difficult it may be, even for the most exalted and pure executive, to
escape suspicion or reproach, when he is not chosen directly by the people.
Similar suggestions will scarcely ever fail of being made, whenever a
distinguished representative obtains office after an election of president,
to which he has contributed.  The learned editor of Blackstone's
Commentaries has spoken with exceeding zeal of the dangers arising from the
intrigues and cabals of an election by the house of representatives.  1

who is to serve, and whether the speaker of the house of representatives,
then extinct, could be deemed the person intended.  1 Kent's Comm. Lect.
13, p. 260, 261. In order to provide for the exigency of a vacancy in the
office of president during the recess of congress, it ha. become usual for
the vice-president, a few days before the termination of each session of
congress, to retire from the chair of the senate, to enable that body to
elect a president pro tempore to be ready to act in any ease of emergency.
