  § 1483.
 </b>
 Having thus considered the manner, in which the executive

department is organized, the next inquiry is, as to the powers, with which

it is entrusted. These, and the.corresponding duties, are enumerated in the

second and third sections of the second article of the constitution.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1484.
 </b>
 The first clause of the second section is, "The

President shall be

commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the

militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the

United States.
 <sup>
  <a href="#1">
   1
  </a>
 </sup>
 He may require the opinion in writing of the principal

officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating to

the duties of their respective offices.  And he shall have power to grant

reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in

cases of impeachment."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1485.
 </b>
 The command and application of the public force, to

execute the

laws, to maintain peace, and to resist foreign invasion, are powers so

obviously of an executive nature, and require the exercise of qualities so

peculiarly adapted to this department, that a well-organized government can

scarcely exist, when they are taken away from it.
 <sup>
  <a href="#2">
   2
  </a>
 </sup>
 Of all the cases and

concerns of government, the direction of war most peculiarly demands those

qualities, which distinguish
</p>
<p>
 the exercise of power by a single hand.
 <sup>
  <a href="#3">
   3
  </a>
 </sup>
 Unity of plan, promptitude,

activity, and decision, are indispensable to success; and these can

scarcely exist, except when a single magistrate is entrusted exclusively

with the power.  Even the coupling of the authority of an executive council

with him, in the exercise of such powers, enfeebles the system, divides the

responsibility, and not unfrequently defeats every energetic measure.

Timidity, indecision, obstinacy, and pride of opinion, must mingle in all

such councils, and infuse a torpor and sluggishness, destructive of all

military operations.  Indeed, there would seem to be little reason to

enforce the propriety of giving this power to the executive department,

(whatever may be its actual organization,) since it is in exact coincidence

with the provisions of our state constitutions; and therefore seems to be

universally deemed safe, if not vital to the system.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1486.
 </b>
 Yet the clause did not wholly escape animadversion in

the state

conventions.  The propriety of admitting the president to be

commander-in-chief, so far as to give orders, and have a general

superintendency, was admitted.  But it was urged, that it would be

dangerous to let him command in person without any restraint, as he might

make a bad use of it.  The consent of both houses of congress ought,

therefore, to be required, before he should take the actual command.
 <sup>
  <a href="#4">
   4
  </a>
 </sup>
 The

answer then given was, that though the president might, there was no

necessity, that he should, take the command in person; and there was no

probability, that he would do so, except in extraordinary emergencies, and

when he was possessed
</p>
<p>
 of superior military talents.
 <sup>
  <a href="#5">
   5
  </a>
 </sup>
 But if his assuming the actual command

depended upon the assent of congress, what was to be done, when an

invasion, or insurrection took place during the recess of congress?

Besides; the very power of restraint might be so employed, as to cripple

the executive department, when filled by a man of extraordinary military

genius.  The power of the president, too, might well be deemed safe; since

he could not, of himself, declare war, raise armies, or call forth the

militia, or appropriate money for the purpose; for these powers all

belonged to congress.
 <sup>
  <a href="#6">
   6
  </a>
 </sup>
 in Great Britain, the king is not only

commander-in-chief of the army, and navy, and militia, but he can declare

war; and, in time of war, can raise. armies and navies, and call forth the

militia of his own mere will.
 <sup>
  <a href="#7">
   7
  </a>
 </sup>
 So, that (to use the words of Mr. Justice

Blackstone) the sole supreme government and command of the militia within

all his majesty's realms and dominions, and of all forces by sea and land,

and of all forts and places of strength, ever was and is the undoubted

right of his majesty; and both houses or either house of parliament cannot,

nor ought to pretend to the same.
 <sup>
  <a href="#8">
   8
  </a>
 </sup>
 The only power of check by parliament

is, the refusal of supplies; and this is found to be abundantly sufficient

to protect the nation against any war against the sense of the nation, or

any serious abuse of the power in modern times.
 <sup>
  <a href="#9">
   9
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1487.
 </b>
 The next provision is, as to the power of the president, to

require the opinions in writing of the heads of the executive departments.

It has been remarked, that this is a mere redundancy, and the right would

result from the very nature of the office.
 <sup>
  <a href="#10">
   10
  </a>
 </sup>
 Still, it is not without use,

as it imposes a more strict responsibility, and recognises a public duty of

high importance and value in critical times.  It has, in the progress of

the government, been repeatedly acted, upon; but by no president with more

wisdom and propriety, than by President Washington.
 <sup>
  <a href="#11">
   11
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1488.
 </b>
 The next power is, "to grant reprieves and pardons."

It has been

said by the marquis Beccaria, that the power of pardon does not exist under

a perfect administration of the laws; and that the admission of the power

is a tacit acknowledgment of the infirmi-
</p>
<p>
 ty of the course of justice.
 <sup>
  <a href="#12">
   12
  </a>
 </sup>
 But if this be a defect at all, it arises

from the infirmity of human nature generally; and in this view, is no more

objectionable, than any other power of government; for every such power,

in some sort, arises from human infirmity.  But if it be meant, that it is

an imperfection in human legislation to admit the power of pardon in any

case, the proposition may well be denied, and some proof, at least, be

required of its sober reality.  The common argument is, that where

punishments are mild, they ought to be certain; and that the clemency of

the chief magistrate is a tacit disapprobation of the laws.  But surely no

man in his senses will contend, that any system of laws can provide for

every possible shade of guilt, a proportionate degree of punishment.  The

most, that ever has been, and ever can be done, is to provide for the

punishment of crimes by some general rules, and within some general

limitations.  The total exclusion of all power of pardon would necessarily

introduce a very dangerous power in judges and juries, of following the

spirit, rather than the letter of the laws; or, out of humanity, of

suffering real offenders wholly to escape punishment; or else, it must be

holden, (what no man will seriously avow,) that the situation and

circumstances of the offender, though they alter not the essence of the

offence, ought to make no distinction in the punishment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#13">
   13
  </a>
 </sup>
 There are not

only various gradations of guilt in the commission of the same crime, which

are not susceptible of any previous enumeration and definition; but the

proofs must, in many cases, be imperfect in their own nature, not only as

to the actual commission of the
</p>
<p>
 Offence, but also, as to the aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  In

many cases, convictions must be founded upon presumptions and

probabilities.  Would it not be at once unjust and unreasonable to exclude

all means of mitigating punishment, when subsequent inquiries should

demonstrate, that the accusation was wholly unfounded, or the crime greatly

diminished in point or atrocity and aggravation, from what the evidence at

the trial seemed to establish?  A power to pardon seems, indeed,

indispensable under the most correct administration of the law by human

tribunals; since, otherwise, men would sometimes fall a prey to the

vindictiveness of accusers, the inaccuracy of testimony, and the

fallibility of jurors and courts.
 <sup>
  <a href="#14">
   14
  </a>
 </sup>
 Besides; the law maybe broken, and yet

the offender be placed in such circumstances, that he will stand, in a

great measure, and perhaps wholly, excused in moral and general justice,

though not in the strictness of the law.  What then is to be done?  Is he

to be acquitted against the law; or convicted, and to suffer punishment

infinitely beyond his deserts?  If an arbitrary power is to be given to

meet such cases, where can it be so properly lodged, as in the executive

department?
 <sup>
  <a href="#15">
   15
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1489.
 </b>
 Mr. Justice Blackstone says, that "in democracies, this

power of

pardon can never subsist; for, there, nothing higher is acknowledged, than

the magistrate, who administers the laws; and it would be impolitic for the

power of judging, and of pardoning to center in one and the same person.

This (as the president Montesquieu, observes)1 would oblige him very often

to contradict himself, to make and unmake his decisions.  It would tend to

confound all ideas of right among the mass of the people, as they would

find it difficult to tell, whether a prisoner was discharged by his

innocence, or obtained a pardon through favour."
 <sup>
  <a href="#17">
   17
  </a>
 </sup>
 And hence, he deduces the

superiority of a monarchical government; because in monarchies, the king

acts in a superior sphere; and may, therefore, safely be trusted with the

power of pardon, and it becomes a source of personal loyalty and

affection.
 <sup>
  <a href="#18">
   18
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1490.
 </b>
 But, surely, this reasoning is extremely forced and

artificial.

In the first place, there is more difficulty or absurdity in a democracy,

than in a monarchy, in such cases, if the power of judging and pardoning be

in the same lands; as if tile monarch be at once the judge, and the person,

who pardons.  And Montesquieu's reasoning is in fact addressed to this very

case of a monarch, who is at once the judge, and dispenser of pardons.
 <sup>
  <a href="#19">
   19
  </a>
 </sup>
 In

the next place, there is no inconsistency in a democracy any more, than in

a monarchy, in entrusting one magistrate with a power to try
</p>
<p>
 the cause, and another with a power to pardon. The one power is not

incidental to, but in contrast with the other.  Nor, if both powers were

lodged in the same magistrate, would there be any danger of their being

necessarily confounded; for they may be required to be acted upon

separately, and at different times, so as to be known as distinct

prerogatives.  But, in point of fact, no such reasoning has the slightest

application to the American governments, or, indeed, to any others, where

there is a separation of the general departments of government,

legislative, judicial, and executive, and the powers of each are

administered by distinct persons.  What difficulty is there in the people

delegating the judicial power to one body of magistrates, and the power of

pardon to another, in a republic any more, than there is in the king's

delegating the judicial power to magistrates, and reserving the pardoning

power to himself, in a monarchy?
 <sup>
  <a href="#20">
   20
  </a>
 </sup>
 In truth, the learned author, in his

extreme desire to recommend a kingly form of government, seems on this, as

on many other occasions, to have been misled into the most loose and

inconclusive statements.  There is not a single state in the Union, in

which there is not by its constitution a power of pardon lodged in some one

department of government, distinct from the judicial.
 <sup>
  <a href="#21">
   21
  </a>
 </sup>
 And the power of

remitting penalties is in some cases, even in England, entrusted to

judicial officers.
 <sup>
  <a href="#22">
   22
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1491.
 </b>
 So far from the power of pardon being in-
</p>
<p>
 compatible with the fundamental principles or a republic, it may be boldly

asserted to be peculiarly appropriate, and safe in all free states; because

the power can there be guarded by a just responsibility for its exercise.
 <sup>
  <a href="#23">
   23
  </a>
 </sup>
 Little room will be left for favouritism, personal caprice, or personal

resentment.  If the power should ever be abused, it would be far less

likely to occur in opposition, than in obedience to the will of the people.

The danger is not, that in republics the victims of the law will too often

escape punishment by a pardon; but that the power will not be sufficiently

exerted in cases, where public feeling accompanies the prosecution, and

assigns the ultimate doom to persons, who have been convicted upon slender

testimony, or popular suspicions.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1492.
 </b>
 The power to pardon, then, being a fit one to be

entrusted to all

governments, humanity and sound policy dictate, that this benign

prerogative should be, as little as possible, lettered, or embarrassed.

The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity,

that, without an easy access to exceptions in favour of unfortunate guilt,

justice would assume an aspect too sanguinary and cruel.  The only question

is, in what department of the government it can be most safely lodged; and

that must principally refer to the executive, or legislative department.

The reasoning in favour of vesting it in the executive department may be

thus stated.  A sense of responsibility is always strongest in proportion,

as it is undivided.  A single person would, therefore, be most ready to

attend to the force of those motives, which
</p>
<p>
 might plead for a mitigation of the rigour of the law; and the least apt to

yield to considerations, which were calculated to shelter a fit object of

its vengeance. The consciousness, that the life, or happiness of an

offender was exclusively within his discretion, would inspire

scrupulousness and caution; and the dread of being accused of weakness, or

connivance, would beget circumspection of a different sort.  On the other

hand, as men generally derive confidence from numbers, a large assembly

might naturally encourage each other in acts of obduracy, as no one would

feel much apprehension of public censure.
 <sup>
  <a href="#24">
   24
  </a>
 </sup>
 A public body, too, ordinarily

engaged in other duties, would be little apt to sift cases of this sort

thoroughly to the bottom, and would be disposed to yield to the

solicitations, or be guided by the prejudices of a few; and thus shelter

their own acts of yielding too much, or too little, under the common

apology of ignorance, or confidence.  A single magistrate would be

compelled to search, and act upon his own responsibility; and therefore

would be at once a more enlightened dispenser of mercy, and a more firm

administrator of public justice.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1493.
 </b>
 There are probably few persons now, who would not

consider the

power of pardon in ordinary cases, as best deposited with the president.

But the expediency of vesting it in.him in any cases, and especially in

cases of treason, was doubted at the time of adopting the constitution; and

it was then urged, that it ought at least in cases of treason to be vested

in one, or both branches of the legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
 </sup>
 That there are strong

reasons, which may be assigned in favour of vesting the power in congress

in cases of treason, need
</p>
<p>
 not be denied.  As treason is a crime levelled at the immediate existence

of society, when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the offender,

there would seem to be a fitness in referring the expediency of an act of

mercy towards him to the judgment of the legislature.
 <sup>
  <a href="#26">
   26
  </a>
 </sup>
 But there are

strong reasons also against it. Even in such cases a single magistrate, of

prudence and sound sense, would be better fitted, than a numerous assembly,

in such delicate conjunctures, to weigh the motives for and against the

remission of the punishment, and to ascertain all the facts without undue

influence.  The responsibility would be more felt, and more direct.

Treason, too, is a crime, that will often be connected with seditions,

embracing a large portion of a particular community; and might under such

circumstances, and especially where parties were nearly poised, find

friends and favourites, as well as enemies and opponents, in the councils

of the nation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#27">
   27
  </a>
 </sup>
 So, that the chance of an impartial judgment might be less

probable in such bodies, than in a single person at the head of the nation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1494.
 </b>
 A still more satisfactory reason is, that the

legislature is not

always in session; and that their proceedings, must be necessarily slow,

and are generally not completed, until after long delays.  The inexpediency

of deferring the execution of any criminal sentence, until a long and

indefinite time after a conviction, is felt in all communities.  It

destroys one of the best effects of punishment, that, which arises from a

prompt and certain administration of justice following close upon the

offence.  If the legislature is invested with
</p>
<p>
 the authority to pardon, it is obviously indispensable, that no sentence

can be properly executed, at least in capital cases, until they have had

time to act.  And a mere postponement of the subject from session to

session would be naturally sought by all those, who favoured the convict,

and yet doubted the success of his application.  In many cases delay would

be equivalent to a pardon, as to its influence upon public opinion, either

in weakening the detestation of the crime, or encouraging the commission of

it.  But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardon in the

executive magistrate in cases of treason is, that in seasons of

insurrection, or rebellion, there are critical moments, when a well-timed

offer of pardon to the insurgents, or rebels, may restore the tranquillity

of the Commonwealth; and if these are suffered to pass unimproved, it may

be impossible afterwards to interpose with the same success.  The dilatory

process of convening the. legislature, or one of the branches, for the

purpose of sanctioning such a measure, would frequently be the loss of the

golden opportunity.  The loss of a week, of a day, or even of an hour may

sometimes prove fatal.  If a discretionary power were confided to the

president to act in such emergencies, it would greatly diminish the

importance of the restriction.  And it would generally be impolitic to hold

out, either by the constitution or by law, a prospect of impunity by

confiding the exercise of the power to the executive in special eases;

since it might be construed into an argument of timidity or weakness, and

thus have a tendency to embolden guilt.
 <sup>
  <a href="#28">
   28
  </a>
 </sup>
 In point of fact, the power has

always been found safe in the hands of the state executives in trea-
</p>
<p>
 son, as well as in other cases; and there can be no practical reason, why

it should not be equally safe with the executive of the Union.
 <sup>
  <a href="#29">
   29
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1495.
 </b>
 There is an exception to the power of pardon, that it

shall not

extend to cases of impeachment, which takes from the president every

temptation to abuse it in cases of political and official offences by

persons in the public service.  The power of impeachment will generally be

applied to persons holding high offices under the government; and it is of

great consequence, that the president should not have the power of

preventing a thorough investigation of their conduct, or of securing them

against the disgrace of a public conviction by impeachment, if they should

deserve it. The constitution has, therefore, wisely interposed this check

upon his power, so that he cannot, by any corrupt coalition with

favourites, or dependents in high offices, screen them from punishment.
 <sup>
  <a href="#30">
   30
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1496.
 </b>
 In England (from which this exception was probably

borrowed) no

pardon can be pleaded in bar of an impeachment.  But the king may, after

conviction upon an impeachment, pardon the offender.  His prerogative,

therefore, cannot prevent the disgrace of a conviction; but it may avert

its effects, and restore the offender to his credit.
 <sup>
  <a href="#31">
   31
  </a>
 </sup>
 The president

possesses .no such power in any case of impeachment; and, as the
</p>
<p>
 viction, as there is in England; since (as we have seen) the judgment

there, so that it does not exceed what is allowed by law, lies wholly in

the breast of the house of lords, as to its nature and extent, and may, in

many cases, not only reach the life, but the whole fortune of the offender.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1497.
 </b>
 It would seem to result from the principle, on which

the power of

each branch of the legislature to punish for contempts is founded, that the

executive authority cannot interpose between them and the offender.  The

main object is to secure a purity, independence, and ability of the

legislature adequate to the discharge of all their duties.  If they can be

overawed by force, or corrupted by largesses, or interrupted in their

proceedings by violence, without the means of self-protection, it is

obvious, that they willsoon be found incapable of legislating with wisdom

or independence. If the executive should possess the power of pardoning any

such offender, they would be wholly dependent upon his good will and

pleasure for the exercise of their own powers.  Thus, in effect, the rights

of the people entrusted to them would be placed in perpetual jeopardy. The

constitution is silent in respect to the right of granting pardons in such

cases, as it is in respect to the jurisdiction to punish for contempts.

The latter arises by implication; and to make it effectual the former is

excluded by implication.
 <sup>
  <a href="#32">
   32
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1498.
 </b>
 Subject to these exceptions, (and perhaps there may be

others of a

like nature standing on special grounds,) the power of pardon is general

and unqualified, reaching from the highest to the lowest offences.  The

power of remission of fines, penalties, and forfeitures is
</p>
<p>
 also included in it; and may in the last resort be exercised by the

executive, although it is in many cases by our laws confided to the

treasury department.
 <sup>
  <a href="#33">
   33
  </a>
 </sup>
 No law can abridge the constitutional powers of the

executive department, or interrupt its right to interpose by pardon in such

cases.
 <sup>
  <a href="#34">
   34

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1499.
 </b>
 The next clause is: "He (the president) shall have

power, by and

with the advice and consent of the senate, to make treaties, provided two

thirds of the senators present concur.  And he shall nominate, and, by and

with the advice and consent of.the senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other

public ministers, and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other

officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise

provided for, and which shall be established by law.  But the congress may

by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think

proper, in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of

departments."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1500.
 </b>
 The first power, "to make treaties," was not in the

original draft

of the constitution; but was afterwards reported by a committee; and after

some ineffectual attempts to amend, it was adopted, in substance, as it now

stands, except, that in the report the advice and consent of two thirds of

the senators was not required to a treaty of peace.  This exception was

struck out by a vote of eight states against three.  The principal struggle

was, to require two thirds of the
</p>
<p>
 whole number of members of the senate, instead of two thirds of those present.
 <sup>
  <a href="#35">
   35
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1501.
 </b>
 Under the confederation congress possessed the sole

and exclusive

power of "entering into treaties and alliances, provided, that no treaty of

commerce shall be made, whereby the legislative power of the respective

states shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on

foreigners, as their own people were subjected to; or from prohibiting the

exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities

whatsoever."  But no treaty or alliance could be entered into, unless by

the assent of nine of the states.
 <sup>
  <a href="#36">
   36
  </a>
 </sup>
 These limitations upon the power were

found very inconvenient in practice; and indeed, in conjunction with other

defects, contributed to the prostration, and utter imbecility of the

confederation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#37">
   37
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1502.
 </b>
 The power "to make treaties" is by the constitution

general; and

of course it embraces all sorts of treaties, for peace or war; for commerce

or territory; for alliance or succours; for indemnity for injuries or

payment of debts; for the recognition and enforcement of principles of

public law; and for any other purposes, which the policy or interests of

independent sovereigns may dictate in their intercourse with each other.
 <sup>
  <a href="#38">
   38
  </a>
 </sup>
 But though the power is thus general and unrestricted, it is not to be so

construed, as to destroy the fundamental laws of the state.  A power given

by the constitution cannot be construed to authorize a destruction of other

powers given in the same instrument.  It must be con-
</p>
<p>
 strued, therefore, in subordination to it; and cannot supersede, or

interfere with any other of its fundamental provisions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#39">
   39
  </a>
 </sup>
 Each is equally

obligatory, and of paramount authority within its scope; and no one

embraces a right to annihilate any other.  A treaty to change the

organization of the government, or annihilate its sovereignty, to overturn

its republican form, or to deprive it of its constitutional powers, would

be void; because it would destroy, what it was designed merely to fulfil,

the will of the people.  Whether there are any other restrictions;

necessarily growing out of the structure of the government, will remain to

be considered, whenever the exigency shall arise.
 <sup>
  <a href="#40">
   40
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1503.
 </b>
 The power of making treaties is indispensable to the

due exercise

of national sovereignty, and very important, especially as it relates to

war, peace, and commerce.  That it should belong to the national government

would seem to be irresistibly established by every argument deduced from

experience, from public policy, and a close survey of the objects of

government. It is difficult to circumscribe the power within any definite

limits, applicable to all times and exigencies, without impairing its

efficacy, or defeating its purposes. The constitution has, therefore, made

it general and unqualified.  This very circumstance, however, renders it

highly important, that it should be delegated in such
</p>
<p>
 a mode, and with such precautions, as will afford the highest security,

that it will be exercised by men the best qualified for the purpose, and in

the manner most conducive to the public good.
 <sup>
  <a href="#41">
   41
  </a>
 </sup>
 With such views, the

question was naturally presented in the convention, to what body shall it

be delegated?  It might be delegated to congress generally, as it was under

the confederation, exclusive of the president, or in conjunction with him.

It might be delegated to either branch of the legislature, exclusive of, or

in conjunction with him. Or it might be exclusively delegated to the

president.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1504.
 </b>
 In the formation of treaties, secrecy and immediate

despatch are

generally requisite, and sometimes absolutely indispensable.  Intelligence

may often be obtained, and measures matured in secrecy, which could never

be done, unless in the faith and confidence of profound secrecy.  No man at

all acquainted with diplomacy, but must have felt, that the success of

negotiations as often depends upon their being unknown by the public, as

upon their justice or their policy. Men will assume responsibility in

private, and communicate information, and express opinions, which they

would feel the greatest repugnance publicly to avow; and measures may be

defeated by the intrigues and management of foreign powers, if they suspect

them to be in progress, and understand their precise nature and extent.  In

this view the executive department is a far better depositary of the power,

than congress would be. The delays incident to a large assembly; the

differences of opinion; the time consumed in debate; and the utter

impossibility of secrecy, all combine to render them unfitted for the

purposes of diplomacy.  And our
</p>
<p>
 own experience during the confederation abundantly demonstrated all the

evils, which the theory would lead us to expect.
 <sup>
  <a href="#42">

 </sup>
 Besides; there are tides

in national affairs, as well as in the affairs of private life.  To discern

and profit by them is the part of true political wisdom; and the loss of a

week, or even of a day, may sometimes change the whole aspect of affairs,

and render negotiations wholly nugatory, or indecisive.  The loss of a

battle, the death of a prince, the removal of a minister, the pressure or

removal of fiscal embarrassments at the moment, and other circumstances,

may change the whole posture of affairs, and ensure success, or defeat the

best concerted project.
 <sup>
  <a href="#43">

 </sup>
 The executive, having a constant eye upon foreign

affairs, can promptly meet, and even anticipate such emergencies, and avail

himself of all the advantages accruing from them; while a large assembly

would be coldly deliberating on the chances of success, and the policy of

opening negotiations.  It is manifest, then, that congress would not be a

suitable depositary of the power.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1505.
 </b>
 The same difficulties would occur from confiding it

exclusively to

either branch of congress.  Each is too numerous for prompt and immediate

action, and secrecy.  The matters in negotiations, which usually require

these qualities in the highest degree, are the preparatory and auxiliary

measures; and which are to be seized upon, as it were, in an instant.  The

president could easily arrange them.  But the house, or the senate, if in

session, could not act, until after great delays; and in the recess could

not act all.  To have entrusted the power to either would have been to

relinquish the benefits of the constitutional agency of the
</p>
<p>
 president in the conduct of foreign negotiations.  It is true, that the

branch so entrusted might have the option to employ the president in that

capacity; but they would also have the option of refraining from it; and it

cannot be disguised, that pique, or cabal, or.personal or political

hostility, might induce them to keep their pursuits at a distance from his

inspection and participation.  Nor could it be expected, that the

president, as a mere ministerial agent of such branch, would enjoy. the

confidence and respect of foreign powers to the same extent, as he would,

as the constitutional representative of the nation itself; and his

interposition would of course have less efficacy and weight.

 On the other hand, considering the delicacy and extent

of the

power, it is too much to expect, that a free people would confide to a

single magistrate, however respectable, the sole authority to act

conclusively, as well as exclusively, upon the subject of treaties.  In

England, the power to make treaties is exclusively vested in the crown.
 <sup>
  <a href="#45">
   45

 But however proper it may be in a monarchy, there is no American statesman,

but must feel, that such a prerogative in an American president would be

inexpedient and dangerous.
 <sup>
  <a href="#46">

 It would be inconsistent with that wholesome

abuse of it.
 <sup>
  <a href="#47">
   47

 The check, which acts upon the mind from the consideration,

that what is done is but preliminary, and requires the assent of other

independent minds to give it a legal conclusiveness, is a restraint, which

awakens caution, and compels to deliberation.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1507.
 </b>
 The plan of the constitution is happily adapted to attain

all just

objects in relation to foreign negotiations.  While it confides the power

to the executive department, it guards it from serious abuse by placing it

under the ultimate superintendence of a select body of high character and

high responsibility.  It is indeed clear to a demonstration, that this

joint possession of the power affords a greater security for its just

exercise, than the separate possession of it by either.
 <sup>
  <a href="#48">
   48
  </a>
 </sup>
 The president is

the immediate author and finisher of all treaties; and all the advantages,

which can be derived from talents, information; integrity, and deliberate

investigation on the one hand, and from secrecy and despatch on the other,

are thus combined in the system.
 <sup>
  <a href="#49">
   49
  </a>
 </sup>
 But no treaty, so formed, becomes

binding upon the country, unless it receives the deliberate assent of two

thirds of the senate.  In that body all the states are equally represented;

and, from the nature of the appointment and duration of the office, it may

fairly be presumed at all times to contain a very large portion of talents,

experience, political wisdom, and sincere patriotism, a spirit of

liberality, and a deep devotion to all the substantial interests of the

country.  The constitutional check of requiring two thirds to confirm a

treaty is, of itself, a sufficient guaranty against any wanton sacrifice of

private rights, or any betrayal of public privileges.  To suppose otherwise

would be to suppose, that a representative republican government was a mere

phantom; that the state legislatures were incapable, or unwilling to choose

senators possessing due qualifications; and that the people would

voluntarily confide power to those, who were ready to promote
</p>
<p>
 their ruin, and endanger, or destroy their liberties. Without supposing a

case of utter indifference, or utter corruption in the people, it would be

impossible, that the senate should be so constituted at any time, as that

the honour and interests of the country would not be safe in their hands.

When such an indifference, or corruption shall have arrived, it will be in

vain to prescribe any remedy; for the constitution will have crumbled into

ruins, or have become a mere shadow, about which it would be absurd to

disquiet ourselves.

seems, upon

were assailed with more vehemence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#51">

 One ground of objection was, the trite

topic of an intermixture of the executive and legislative powers; some

contending, that the president ought alone to possess the prerogative of

making treaties; and others, that it ought to be exclusively deposited in

the senate.  Another objection was, the smallness of the number of the

persons, to whom the power was confided; some being of opinion, that the

house of representatives ought to be associated in its exercise; and

others, that two thirds of all the members of the senate, and not two

thirds of all the members present, should be required to ratify a treaty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#52">

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1509.
 </b>
 In relation to the objection. that the power ought to

have been

confided exclusively to the president, it may be suggested in addition to

the preceding remarks, that, however safe it may be in governments, where

the executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to him the

entire power of making
</p>
<p>
 treaties, it would be utterly unsafe and improper to entrust that power to

an executive magistrate chosen for four years.  It has been remarked, and

is unquestionably true, that an hereditary monarch, though often the

oppressor of his people, has personally too much at stake in the government

to be in any material danger of corruption by foreign powers, so as to

surrender any important rights or interests.  But a man, raised from a

private station to the rank of chief magistrate for a short period, having

but a slender or moderate fortune, and no very deep Stake in the society,

might sometimes be under temptations to sacrifice duty to interest, which

it would require great virtue to withstand. If ambitious, he might be

tempted to seek his own aggrandizement by the aid of a foreign power, and

use the field of negotiations for this purpose.  If avaricious, he might

make his treachery to his constituents a vendible article at an enormous

price.  Although such occurrences are not ordinarily to be expected; yet

the history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human

nature, which would make it wise in a nation to commit its most delicate

interests and momentous concerns to the unrestrained disposal of a single

magistrate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#53">

 It is far more wise to interpose checks upon the actual

exercise.of the power, than remedies to redress, or punish an abuse of it.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1510.
 </b>
 The impropriety of delegating the power exclusively to

the senate

has been already sufficiently considered.  And, in addition to what has

been already urged against the participation of the house of

representatives in it, it may be remarked, that the house of

representatives is for other reasons far less fit, than 'the
</p>
<p>
 senate, to be the exclusive depositary of the power, or to hold it in

conjunction with the executive.  In the first place, it is a popular

assembly, chosen immediately from the people, and representing, in a good

measure, their feelings and local interests; and it will on this account be

more likely to be swayed by such feelings and interests, than the senate,

chosen by the states through the voice of the state legislatures.  In the

next place, the house of representatives are chosen for two years only; and

the internal composition of the body is constantly changing so, as to admit

of less certainty in their opinions, and their measures, than would

naturally belong to a body of longer duration.  In the next place, the

house of representatives is far more numerous, than the senate, and will be

constantly increasing in numbers so, that it will be more slow in its

movements, and more fluctuating in its councils.  In the next place, the

senate will naturally be composed of persons of more experience, weight of

character, and talents, than the members of the house.  Accurate knowledge

of foreign politics, a steady and systematic adherence to the same views,

nice and uniform sensibility to national character, as well as secrecy,

decision, and despatch, are required for a due execution of the power to

make treaties. And, if these are not utterly incompatible with the genius

of a numerous and variable body, it must be admitted, that they will be

more rarely found there, than in a more select body, having a longer

duration in office, and representing, not the interests of private

constituents alone, but the sovereignty of states.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1511.
 </b>
 Besides; the very habits of business, and the

uniformity and

regularity of system, acquired by a long possession of office, are of great

concern in all
</p>
<p>
 cases of this sort.  The senators from the longer duration of their office

will have great opportunities of extending their political information, and

of rendering their experience more and more beneficial to their country.

The members are slowly changed; so, that the body will at all times, from

its very organization, comprehend a large majority of persons, who have

been engaged for a considerable time in public duties, and foreign affairs.

If, in addition to all these reasons, it is considered, that in the senate

all the states are equally represented, and in the house very unequally,

there can be no reasonable doubt, that the senate is in all respects a more

competent, and more suitable depositary of the power, than the house,

either with, or without the co-operation of the executive.  And most of the

reasoning applies with equal force to any participation by the house in the

treaty-making functions.  It would add an unwieldly machinery to all

foreign operations; and retard, if not wholly prevent, the beneficial

purposes of the power.
 <sup>
  <a href="#54">
   54
  </a>
 </sup>
 Yet such a scheme has not been without warm

advocates.  And it has been thought an anomaly, that, while the power to

make war was confided to both branches of congress, the power to make peace

was within the reach of one, with the co-operation of the president.
 <sup>
  <a href="#55">
   55
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1512.
 </b>
 But there will be found no inconsistency, or

inconvenience in this

diversity of power.  Considering the vast expenditures and calamities, with

which war is attended, there is certainly the strongest ground for
</p>
<p>
 confiding it to the collected wisdom of the national councils.  It requires

one party only to declare war; but it requires the co-operation and consent

of both belligerents to make peace.  No negotiations are necessary in the

former case; in the latter, they are indispensable.  Every reason,

therefore, for entrusting the treaty-making power to the president and

senate in common negotiations, applies a fortiori to a treaty of peace.

Indeed, peace is so important to the welfare of a republic, and so suited

to all its truest interests, as well as to its liberties, that it can

scarcely be made too facile. While, on the other hand, war is at all times

so great an evil, that it can scarcely be made too difficult.  The power to

make peace can never be unsafe for the nation in the hands of the president

and two thirds of the senate.  The power to prevent it, may not be without

hazard in the hands of the house of representatives, who may be too much

under the control of popular excitement, or legislative rivalry, to act at

all times with the same degree of impartiality and caution.  In the

convention, a proposition to except treaties of peace from the

treaty-making power was, at one time, inserted, but was afterwards

deliberately abandoned.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1513.
 </b>
 In regard to the objection, that the arrangement is a

violation of

the fundamental rule, that the legislative and executive departments ought

to be kept separate; it might be sufficient to advert to the considerations

stated in another place, which show, that the true sense of the rule does

not require a total separation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#57">
   57
  </a>
 </sup>
 But, in truth, the nature of the power of

making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in the Union of the

executive and the senate in the exercise of it.
</p>
<p>
 Though some Writers on government place this power in the class of

executive authorities; yet, it is an arbitrary classification;  and, if

attention is given to its operation, it will be found to partake mere of

the legislative, than of the executive character.  The essence of

legislation is to prescribe law, or regulations for society; while the

execution of those laws and regulations, and the employment of the common

strength, either for that purpose, or for the common defence, seem to

comprize all the functions of the executive magistrate.  The power of

making treaties is plainly neither the one, nor the other.  It relates,

neither to the execution of subsisting laws, nor to the enactment of new

ones; and still less does it relate to the exertion of the common strength.

Its objects are contracts with foreign nations, which have the force of

law with us; but, as to the foreign sovereigns, have only the obligation of

good faith.  Treaties are not rules prescribed by thesovereign to his

subjects; but agreements between sovereign and sovereign.  The

treaty-making power, therefore, seems to form a distinct department, and to

belong, properly, neither to the legislature, nor the executive, though it

may be said to partake of qualities common to each.  The president, from

his unity, promptitude, and facility of action, is peculiarly well adapted

to carry on the initiative processes; while the senate, representing all

the states, and engaged in legislating for the interests of the whole

country, is equally well fitted to be entrusted with the power of ultimate

ratification.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1514.
 </b>
 The other objection, which would require a concurrence

of two

thirds of all the members of the
</p>
<p>
 senate, and not merely of two thirds of all present, is not better

founded.
 <sup>
  <a href="#59">
   59
  </a>
 </sup>
 All provisions, which require more, than a majority of any body

to its resolutions, have (as has been already intimated) a direct tendency

to embarrass the operations of the government, and an indirect one to

subject the sense of the majority to that of the minority.  This

consideration ought never to be lost sight of; and very strong reasons

ought to exist to justify any departure from the ordinary rule, that the

majority ought to govern.  The constitution has, on this point, gone as far

in the endeavour to secure the advantage of numbers in the formation of

treaties, as can be reconciled either with the activity of the public

councils, or with a reasonable regard to the sense of the major part of the

community. If two thirds of the whole number of members had been required,

it would, in many cases, from a non-attendance of a part, amount in

practice to a necessity almost of unanimity. 'The history of every

political establishment, in which such a principle has prevailed, is a

history of impotence, perplexity, and disorder.  Proofs of this position

may be easily adduced from the examples of the Roman tribuneship, the

Polish diet, and the states general of the Netherlands, and even from our

own experience under the confederation.
 <sup>
  <a href="#60">
   60
  </a>
 </sup>
 Under the latter instrument the

concurrence of nine states was necessary, not only to making treaties, but

to many other acts of a less important character; and measures were often

defeated by the non-attendance of members, sometimes by design, and

sometimes by accident.
 <sup>
  <a href="#61">
   61
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is hardly possible, that a treaty could be

ratified by surprise, or tak-
</p>
<p>
 ing advantage of the accidental absence of a few members; and certainly the

motive to punctuality in attendance will be greatly increased by making

such ratification to depend upon the numbers present.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1515.
 </b>
 The Federalist has taken notice of the difference

between the

treaty-making power in England, and that in America in the following terms:

"The president is to have power, with the advice and consent of the senate,

to make treaties, provided two thirds of the members present concur.  The

king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute representative of the

nation, in all foreign transactions.  He can, of his own accord, make

treaties of peace, commerce, alliance, and of every other description. It

has been insinuated, that his authority, in this respect, is not

conclusive; and that his conventions with foreign powers are subject to the

revision, and stand in need of the ratification of parliament.  But, I

believe, this doctrine was never heard of, till it was broached upon the

present occasion. Every jurist of that kingdom, and every other man

acquainted with its constitution, knows, as an established fact, that the

prerogative of making treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plenitude;

and that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most

complete legal validity. and perfection, independ-
</p>
<p>
 ent of any other sanction.  The parliament, it is true, is sometimes seen

employing itself in altering the existing laws, to conform them to the

stipulations in a new treaty; and this may have, possibly, given birth to

the imagination, that its co-operation was necessary to the obligatory

efficacy of the treaty.  But this parliamentary interposition  proceeds

from a different cause; from the necessity of adjusting a most artificial

and intricate system of revenue and commercial laws to the changes made in

them by the operation of the treaty; and of adapting new provisions and

precautions to the new state of things, to keep the machine from running

into disorder.  In this respect, therefore, there is no comparison between

the. intended power of the president, and the actual power of the British

sovereign.  The one can perform alone, what the other can only do with the

concurrence of a branch of the legislature.  It must be admitted, that, in

this instance, the power of the federal executive would exceed that of any

state executive.  But this arises naturally from the exclusive possession,

by the Union, of that part of the sovereign power, which relates to

treaties.  If the confederacy were to be dissolved, it would become a

question, whether the executives of the several states were not solely

invested with that delicate and important prerogative."

 <b>
  § 1516.

 Upon the whole it is difficult to perceive, how the

treaty-making

power could have been better deposited, with a view to its safety and

efficiency. Yet it was declaimed against with uncommon energy, as dangerous

to the commonwealth, and subversive of
</p>
<p>
 public liberty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#64">

 Time has demonstrated the fallacy of such prophecies; and

has confirmed the belief of the friends of the constitution, that it would

be, not only safe, but full of wisdom and sound policy.  Perhaps no

stronger illustration, than this, can be found, of the facility of

suggesting ingenious objections to any system, calculated to create public

alarm, and to wound public confidence, which, at the same time, are

unfounded in human experience, or in just reasoning.

<p>
 <b>
  § 1517.
 </b>
 Some doubts appear to have been entertained in the

early stages of

the government, as to the correct exposition of the constitution in regard

to the agency of the senate in the formation of treaties. The question was,

whether the agency of the senate was admissible previous to the

negotiation, so as to advise on the instructions to be given to the

ministers; or was limited to the exercise of the power of advice and

consent, after the treaty was formed; or whether the president possessed an

option to adopt one mode, or the other, as his judgment might direct.
 <sup>
  <a href="#65">
   65
  </a>
 </sup>
 The

practical exposition assumed on the first occasion, which seems to have

occurred in President Washington's administration, was, that the option

belonged to the executive to adopt either mode, and the senate might advise

before, as well as after, the formation of a treaty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#66">
   66
  </a>
 </sup>
 Since that period,

the senate have been rarely, if ever, consulted, until after a treaty has

been completed, and laid before them for ratification.
 <sup>
  <a href="#67">
   67
  </a>
 </sup>
 When so laid

before the senate, that body is in the habit of deliberating upon it, as,

indeed, it does on all executive business, in secret,
</p>
<p>
 and with closed doors.  The senate may wholly reject the treaty, or advise

and consent to a ratification of part of the articles, rejecting others, or

recommend additional or explanatory articles.  In the event of a partial

ratification, the treaty does not become the law of the land, until the

president and the foreign sovereign have each assented to the modifications

proposed by the senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#68">
   68

 </sup>
 But, although the president may ask the advice

and consent of the senate to a treaty, he is not absolutely bound by it;

for he may, after it is given,
</p>
<p>
 still constitutionally refuse to ratify it.  Such an occurrence will

probably be rare, because the president will scarcely incline to lay a

treaty before the senate, which he is not disposed to ratify.

 The next part of the clause respects appointments to

 <sup>
  <a href="#70">

 The term "ambassador," strictly

construed, (as would seem to be required by the second article of that

instrument,) comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers;
 <sup>
  <a href="#71">
   71
  </a>
 </sup>
 and

excludes those grades, which the United States would be most likely to

prefer, whenever foreign embassies may be necessary.  But under no latitude

of construction could the term, "ambassadors," comprehend consuls.  Yet it

was found necessary by congress to employ the inferior grades of ministers,

and to send and receive consuls. It is true, that the mutual appointment of

consuls might have been provided for by treaty; and where no treaty

existed, congress might perhaps have had the authority under the ninth

article of the confederation, which conferred a general authority to

appoint officers managing the general affairs of the United States. But the

 <b>
  § 1521.
 </b>
 The mode of appointment to office, pointed out by the

constitution, seems entitled to peculiar commendation.  There are several

ways, in which in ordinary cases the power may be vested.  It may be

confided to congress; or to one branch of the legislature; or to the

executive alone; or to the executive in concurrence with any selected

branch.  The exercise of it by the people at large will readily be admitted

by all considerate statesmen, to be impracticable, and therefore need not

be examined.  The suggestions, already made upon the treaty-making power,

and the inconveniences of vesting it in congress, apply with great force to

that of vesting the power of appointment. to office in the
</p>
<p>
 same body.  It would enable candidates for office to introduce all sorts of

cabals, intrigues, and coalitions into congress; and not only distract

their attention from their proper legislative duties; but probably in a

very high degree influence all legislative measures.  A new source of

division and corruption would thus be infused into the public councils,

stimulated by private interests, and pressed by personal solicitations.

What would be to be done, in case the senate and house should disagree in

an appointment?  Are they to vote in convention, or as distinct bodies?

There would be practical difficulties attending both courses; and

experience has not justified the belief, that either would conduce either

to good appointments, or to due responsibility.

 <b>

 The same reasoning would apply to vesting the power

exclusively in

either branch of the legislature.  It would make the patronage of the

government subservient to private interests, and bring into suspicion the

motives and conduct of members of the appointing body.  There would be

great danger, that the elections at the polls might be materially

influenced by this power, to confer, or to withhold favours of this sort.

more open to scrutiny, and less liable to be misunderstood.  If he ventures

upon a system of favoritism, he will not escape censure, and can scarcely

avoid public detection and disgrace.  But in a public body appointments

will be materially influenced by party attachments and dislikes; by private

animosities, and antipathies, and partialities; and will be generally

founded in compromises, having little to do with the merit of candidates,

and much to do with the selfish interests of individuals and cabals.  They

will be too much governed by local, or sectional, or party arrangements.

 A

president, chosen from the nation at large, may well be presumed to possess

high intelligence, integrity, and sense of character.  He will be compelled

to consult public opinion in the most important appointments; and must be

interested to vindicate the propriety of his appointments by selections

from those, whose qualifications are unquestioned, and unquestionable.  If

he should act otherwise, and surrender the public patronage into the hands

of profligate men, or low adventurers, it will be impossible for him long

to retain public favour.  Nothing, no, not even the whole influence of

party, could long screen him from the just indignation of the people.

Though slow, the ultimate award of popular opinion would stamp upon his

conduct its merited infamy.  No president, however weak, or credulous, (if

such a per-
</p>
<p>
 son could ever under any conjuncture of circumstances obtain the office,)

would fail to perceive, or to act upon admonitions of this sort.  At all

events, he would be less likely to disregard them, than a large body of

men, who would share the responsibility, and encourage each other in the

division of the patronage of the government.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1524.
 </b>
 But, though these general considerations might easily

reconcile us

to the choice of vesting the power of appointment exclusively in the

president, in preference to the senate, or house of representatives alone;

the patronage of the government, and the appointments to office are too

important to the public weifare, not to induce great hesitation in vesting

them exclusively in the president.  The power may be abused; and,

assuredly, it will be abused, except in the hands of an executive of great

firmness, independence, integrity, and public spirit.  It should never be

forgotten, that in a republican government offices are established, and are

to be filled, not to gratify private interests and private attachments; not

as a means of corrupt influence, or individual profit; not for cringing

favourites, or court sycophants; but for purposes of the highest public

good; to give dignity, strength, purity, and energy to the administration

of the laws.  It would not, therefore, be a wise course to omit any

precaution, which, at the same time, that it should give to the president a

power over the appointments of those, who are in conjunction with himself

to execute the laws, should also interpose a salutary check upon its abuse,

acting by way of preventive, as well as of remedy.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1525.
 </b>
 Happily, this difficult task has been achieved by the

constitution.  The president is to nominate, and thereby has the sole power

to select for office; but his
</p>
<p>
 nomination cannot confer office, unless approved by a majority of the

senate.  His responsibility and theirs is thus complete, and distinct.  He

can never be compelled to yield to their appointment of a man unfit for

office; and, on the other hand, they may withhold their advice and consent

from any candidate, who in their judgment does not possess due

qualifications for office. Thus, no serious abuse of the power can take

place without the co-operation of two co-ordinate branches,

of the government, acting in distinct spheres; and, if there should be any

improper concession on either side, it is obvious, that from the structure

and changes, incident to each department, the evil cannot long endure, and

will be remedied, as it should be, by the elective franchise.  The

consciousness of this check will make the president more circumspect, and

deliberate in his nominations for office.  He will feel, that, in case of a

disagreement of opinion with the senate, his principal vindication must

depend upon the unexceptionable character of his nomination.  And in case

of a rejection, the most, that can be said, is, that he had not his first

choice.  He will still have a wide range of selection; and his

responsibility to present another candidate, entirely qualified for the

office, will be complete and unquestionable.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1526.
 </b>
 Nor is it to be expected, that the senate will

ordinarily fail of

ratifying the appointment of a suitable person for the office.  Independent

of the desire, which such a body may naturally be presumed to feel, of

having offices suitably filled, (when they cannot make the appointment

themselves,) there will be a responsibility to public opinion for a

rejection, which will overcome all common private wishes.  Cases, indeed,

may be imagined, in which the senate
</p>
<p>
 from party motives, from a spirit of opposition, and even from motives of a

more private nature, may reject a nomination absolutely unexceptionable.

But such occurrences will be rare.  The more common error, (if there shall

be any) will be too great a facility to yield to the executive wishes, as a

means of personal, or popular favour.  A president will rarely want means,

if he shall choose to use them, to induce some members of such a body to

aid his nominations; since a correspondent influence may be fairly presumed

to exist, to gratify such persons in other recommendations for office, and

thus to make them indirectly the dispensers of local patronage.  It will

be, principally, with regard to high officers, such as ambassadors, judges,

heads of departments, and other appointments of great public importance,

that the senate will interpose to prevent an unsuitable choice. Their own

dignity, and sense of character, their duty to their country, and their

very title to office will be materially dependent upon a firm discharge of

their duty on such occasions.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1527.
 </b>
 Perhaps the duties of the president, in the discharge

of this most

delicate and important duty of his office, were never better summed up,

than in the following language of a distinguished commentator.
 <sup>
  <a href="#81">
   81
  </a>
 </sup>
 "A proper

selection and appointment of subordinate officers is one of the strongest

marks of a powerful mind.  It is a duty of the president to acquire, as far
</p>
<p>
 as possible, an intimate knowledge of the capacities and characters of his

fellow citizens; to disregard the importunities of friends; the hints or

menaces of enemies; the bias of party, and the hope of popularity.  The

latter is sometimes the refuge of feeble-minded men; but its gleam is

transient, if it is obtained by a dereliction of honest duty and sound

discretion. Popular favour is best secured by carefully ascertaining, and

strictly pursuing the true interests of the people. The president himself

is elected on the supposition, that he is the most capable citizen to

understand, and promote those interests; and in every appointment he ought

to consider himself as executing a public trust of the same nature.

Neither should the fear of giving offence to the public, or pain to the

individual, deter him from the immediate exercise of his power of removal,

on proof of incapacity, or infidelity in the subordinate officer.  The

public, uninformed of the necessity, may be surprised, and at first

dissatisfied; but public approbation ultimately accompanies the fearless

and upright discharge of duty."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1528.
 </b>
 It was objected by some persons, at the time of the

adoption of

the constitution, that this union of the executive with the senate in

appointments would give the president an undue influence over the senate.

This argument is manifestly untenable, since it supposes, that an undue

influence over the senate is to be acquired by the power of the latter to

restrain him.  Even, if the argument were well founded, the influence of

the president over the senate would be still more increased, by giving him

the exclusive power of appointment; for then he would be wholly beyond

restraint.  The opposite ground was assumed by other persons, who thought

the influence of the
</p>
<p>
 senate over the president would by this means become dangerous, if not

irresistible.
 <sup>
  <a href="#82">
   82
  </a>
 </sup>
 There is more plausibility in this suggestion; but it

proceeds upon unsatisfactory reasoning. It is certain, that the senate

cannot, by their refusal to confirm the nominations of the president,

prevent him from the proper discharge of his duty.  The most, that can be

suggested, is, that they may induce him to yield to their favourites,

instead of his own, by resisting his nominations. But if this should happen

in a few rare instances, it is obvious, that his means of influence would

ordinarily form a counter check.  The power, which can originate the

disposal of honours and emoluments, is more likely to attract, than to be

attracted by the power, which can merely obstruct their course.
 <sup>
  <a href="#83">
   83
  </a>
 </sup>
 But in

truth, in every system of government there are possible dangers, and real

difficulties; and to provide for the suppression of all influence of one

department, in regard to another, would be as visionary, as to provide,

that human passions and feelings should never influence public measures.

The most, that can be done, is to provide checks, and public

responsibility.  The plan of the constitution
</p>
<p>
 seems as nearly perfect for this purpose, as any one can be; and indeed it

has been less censured, than any other important delegation of power in

that instrument.

<p>
 <b>
  § 1529.
 </b>
 The other part of the clause, while it leaves to the

president the

appointment to all offices, not otherwise provided for, enables congress to

vest the
</p>
<p>
 appointment of such inferior officers, as they may think proper, in the

president, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.  The

propriety of this dis-
</p>
<p>
 cretionary power in congress, to some extent, cannot well be questioned.

If any discretion should be allowed, its limits could hardly admit of being

exactly defined;
</p>
<p>
 and it might fairly be left to congress to act according to the lights of

experience.  It is difficult to foresee, or to provide for all the

combinations of circumstances,
</p>
<p>
 which might vary the right to appoint in such cases.  In one age the

appointment might be most proper in the president; and in another age, in a

department.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1530.
 </b>
 In the practical course of the government, there does

not seem to

have been any exact line drawn, who are, and who are not, to be deemed

inferior officers in the sense of the constitution, whose appointment does

not necessarily require the concurrence of the senate.
 <sup>
  <a href="#85">
   85
  </a>
 </sup>
 In many cases of

appointments, congress have required the concurrence of the senate, where,

perhaps, it might not be easy to say, that it was required by the

constitution. The power of congress has been exerted
</p>
<p>
 to a great extent, under this clause, in favour of the executive

department.  The president is by law invested, either solely, or with the

senate, with the appointment of all military and naval officers, and of the

most important civil officers, and especially of those connected with the

administration of justice, the collection of the revenue, and the supplies

and expenditures of the nation.  The courts of the Union possess the narrow

prerogative of appointing their own clerk, and reporter, without any

farther patronage. The heads of department are, in like manner, generally

entitled to the appointment of the clerks in their respective offices.  But

the great anomaly in the system is the enormous patronage of the postmaster

general, who is invested with the sole, and exclusive authority to appoint,

and remove all deputy post-masters; and whose power and influence have

thus, by slow degrees, accumulated, until it is, perhaps, not too much to

say, that it rivals, if it does not exceed, in value and extent, that of

the president himself.  How long a power so vast, and so accumulating,

shall remain without any check on the part of any other branch of the

government, is a question for statesmen, and not for jurists.  But it

cannot be disguised, that it will be idle to impose constitutional

restraints upon high executive appointments, if this power, which pervades

every village of the republic, and exerts an irresistible, though silent,

influence in the direct shape of office, or in the no less inviting form of

lucrative contracts, is suffered to remain with. out scrutiny or rebuke.

It furnishes no argument against the interposition of a check, which shall

require the advice and consent of the senate to appointments, that the

power has not hitherto been abused.  In its own nature, the post-office

establishment is susceptible of
</p>
<p>
 abuse to such an alarming degree; the whole correspondence of the country

is so completely submitted to the fidelity and integrity of the agents, who

conduct it; and the means of making it subservient to mere state policy are

so abundant, that the only surprise is, that it has not already awakened

the public jealousy, and been placed under more effectual control.  It may

be said, Without the slightest disparagement of any officer, who has

presided over it, that if ever the people are to be corrupted, or their

liberties are to be prostrated, this establishment will furnish the most

facile means,. and be the earliest employed to accomplish such a purpose.
 <sup>
  <a href="#86">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1531.
 </b>
 It is observable, that the constitution makes no

mention of any

power of removal by the executive of any officers whatsoever.  As, however,

the tenure of office of no officers, except those in the judicial

department, is, by the constitution, provided to be during good behaviour,

it follows by irresistible inference, that all others must hold their

offices during pleasure, unless congress shall have given some other

duration to their office.
 <sup>
  <a href="#87">
   87
  </a>
 </sup>
 As far as congress constitutionally possess the

power to regulate, and delegate the appointment of "inferior officers," so

far they may prescribe the term of office, the manner in which, and the

persons by whom, the removal, as well as the appointment to office, shall

be made.
 <sup>
  <a href="#88">
   88
  </a>
 </sup>
 But two questions naturally occur upon this subject.  The first

is, to whom, in the absence
</p>
<p>
 of all such legislation, does the power of removal belong; to the

appointing power, or to the executive; to the president and senate, who

have concurred in the appointment, or to the president alone? The next is,

if the power of removal belongs to the executive, in regard to any

appointments confided by the constitution to him; whether congress can give

any duration of office in such cases, not subject to the exercise of this

power of removal?
 <sup>
  <a href="#89">
   89
  </a>
 </sup>
 Hitherto the latter has remained a merely speculative

question, as all our legis-
</p>
<p>
 lation, giving a limited duration to office, recognises the executive power

of removal, as in full force.
 <sup>
  <a href="#90">
   90
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  §1532.
 </b>
 The other is a vastly important practical question;

and, in an

early stage of the government, underwent a most elaborate discussion.
 <sup>
  <a href="#91">
   91
  </a>
 </sup>
 The

language of the constitution is, that the president "shall nominate, and,

by and with the advice and consent of the senate, appoint," &amp;c.  The power

to nominate does not naturally, or necessarily include the power to remove;

and if the power to appoint does include it, then the latterbelongs

conjointly to the executive and the senate. In short, under such

circumstances, the removal takes place in virtue of the new appointment, by

mere operation of law.  It results, and is not separable, from the

appointment itself.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1533.
 </b>
 This was the doctrine maintained with great

earnestness by the

Federalist;
 <sup>
  <a href="#92">
   92
  </a>
 </sup>
 and it had a most material tendency to quiet the just alarms

of the overwhelming influence, and arbitrary exercise of this prerogative

of the executive, which might prove fatal to the personal independence, and

freedom of opinion of public officers, as well as to the public liberties

of. the country.  Indeed, it is utterly impossible not to feel, that, if

this unlimited power of removal does exist, it may be made, in the hands of

a bold and designing
</p>
<p>
 man, of high ambition, and feeble principles, an instrument of the worst

oppression, and most vindictive vengeance.  Even in monarchies, while the

councils of state are subject to perpetual fluctuations and changes, the

ordinary officers of the government are permitted to remain in the silent

possession of their offices, undisturbed by the policy, or the passions of

the favourites of the court.  But in a republic, where freedom of opinion

and action are guaranteed by the very first principles of the government,

if a successful party may first elevate their candidate to office, and then

make him the instrument of their resentments, or their mercenary bargains;

if men may be made spies upon the actions of their neighbours, to displace

them from office; or if fawning sycophants upon the popular leader of the

day may gain his patronage, to the exclusion of worthier and abler men, it

is most manifest, that elections will be corrupted at their very source;

and those, who seek office, will have every motive to delude, and deceive

the people.  It was not, therefore, without reason, that, in the animated

discussions already alluded to, it was urged, that the power of removal was

incident to the power of appointment.  That it would be a most

unjustifiable construction of the constitution, and of its implied powers,

to hold otherwise. That such a prerogative in the executive was in its own

nature monarchical and arbitrary; and eminently dangerous to the best

interests, as well as the liberties, of the country.  It would convert all

the officers of the country into the mere tools and creatures of the

president.  A dependence, so servile on one individual, would deter men of

high and honourable minds from engaging in the public service.  And if,

contrary to expectation, such men should be brought into office, they would

be reduced
</p>
<p>
 to the necessity of sacrificing every principle of independence to the will

of the chief magistrate, or of exposing themselves to the disgrace of being

removed from office, and that too at a time, when it might no longer be in

their power to engage in other pursuits.
 <sup>
  <a href="#93">
   93
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1534.
 </b>
 The Federalist, while denying the existence of the

power, admits

by the clearest implication the full force of the argument, thus addressed

to such a state of executive prerogative.  Its language is: "The consent of

that body (the senate) would be necessary to displace, as well as to

appoint.  A change of the chief magistrate, therefore, could not occasion

so violent, or so general a revolution in the officers of the government,

as might be expected, if he were the sole disposer of offices.  Where a man

in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it, a new

president would be restrained from attempting a change in favour of a

person, more agreeable to him, by the apprehension, that a discountenance

of the senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some degree of

discredit upon himself.  Those, who can best estimate the value of a steady

administration, will be most disposed to prize a provision, which connects

the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation

of that body, which, from the greater permanency of its own composition,

will, in all probability, be less subject to inconstancy, than any other

member of the government."
 <sup>
  <a href="#94">
   94
  </a>
 </sup>
 No man can fail to perceive the entire safety

of the power of removal if it must thus be exercised in conjunction with

the senate.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1535.
 </b>
 On the other hand, those, who after the adoption of the

constitution held the doctrine, (for before that period it never appears to

have been avowed by any of its friends, although it was urged by its

opponents, as a reason for rejecting it,) that the power of removal

belonged to the president, argued, that it resulted from the nature of the

power, and the convenience, and even necessity of its exercise.  It was

clearly in its nature a part of the executive power, and was indispensable

for a due execution of the laws, and a regular administration of the public

affairs.  What would become of the public interests, if during the recess

of the senate the president could not remove an unfaithful public officer?

If he could not displace a corrupt ambassador, or head of department, or

other officer engaged in the finances, or expenditures of the government?

If the executive, to prevent a non-execution of the laws, or a

non-performance of his own proper functions, had a right to suspend an

unworthy officer from office, this power was in no respect distinguishable

from a power of removal.  In fact, it is an exercise, though in a more

moderated form, of the same power.  Besides; it was argued, that the

danger, that a president would remove good men from office was wholly

imaginary.  It was not by the splendour attached to the character of a

particular president like Washington, that such an opinion was to be

maintained.  It was founded on the structure of the office.  The man, in

whose favour a majority of the people of the United States would unite, to

elect him to such an office, had every probability at least in favour of

his principles.  He must be presumed to possess integrity, independence,

and high talents.  It would be impossible, that he should abuse the

patronage of the government, or his power of removal, to the
</p>
<p>
 base purposes of gratifying a party, or of ministering to his own

resentments, or of displacing upright and excellent officers for a moro

difference of opinion.  The public odium, which would inevitably attach to

such conduct, would be a perfect security against it.  And, in truth,

removals made from such motives, or with a view to bestow the offices upon

dependents, or favourites, would be an impeachable offence.
 <sup>
  <a href="#95">
   95
  </a>
 </sup>
 One of the

most distinguished framers of the constitution 2 on that occasion after

having expressed his opinion decidedly in favour of the existence of the

power of removal in the executive, added: "In the first place he will be

impeachable by this house before the senate for such an act of

mal-administration; for I contend, that the wanton removal of meritorious

officers would subject him to impeachment, and removal from his high

trust."

 After a most animated discussion, the vote finally

thirtyfour members against twenty.
 <sup>
  <a href="#98">

 <b>

 That the final decision of this question so made was

greatly

influenced by the exalted character of the president, then in office, was

asserted at the time, and has always been believed.  Yet the doctrine
</p>
<p>
 was opposed, as well as supported, by the highest talents and patriotism of

the country.  The public, however, acquiesced in this decision; and it

constitutes, perhaps, the most extraordinary case in the history of the

government of a power, conferred by implication on the executive by the

assent of a bare majority of congress, which has not been.questioned on

many other occasions.
 <sup>
  <a href="#100">
   100
  </a>
 </sup>
 Even the most jealous advocates of state rights

seem to have slumbered over this vast reach of authority; and have left it

untouched, as the neutral ground of controversy, in which they desired to

reap no harvest, and from which they retired without leaving any

protestations of title or contest.
 <sup>
  <a href="#101">
   101
  </a>
 </sup>
 Nor is this general acquiescence and

silence without a satisfactory explanation.  Until a very recent period,

the power had been exercised in few cases, and generally in such, as led to

their own vindication.  During the administration of President Washington

few removals were made, and none without cause; few were made in that of

the first President Adams.  In that of President Jefferson the circle was

greatly enlarged; but yet it was kept within narrow bounds, and with an

express disclaimer of the right to remove for differences of opinion, or

otherwise, than for some clear public good.  In the administrations of the

subsequent presidents, Madison, Monroe, and J.Q. Adams, a general

moderation and forbearance were exercised with the approbation of the

country, and without disturbing the harmony of the system. Since the

induction into office of President Jackson,
</p>
<p>
 an opposite course has been pursued, and a system of removals and new

appointments to office has been pursued so extensively, that it has reached

a very large proportion of all the offices of honour and profit in the

civil departments of the country.  This is matter of fact; and beyond the

statement of the fact1 it is not the intention of the Commentator to

proceed.  This extraordinary change of system has awakened general

attention, and brought back the whole controversy, with regard to the

executive power of removal, to a severe scrutiny.  Many of the most eminent

statesmen in the country have expressed a deliberate opinion, that it is

utterly indefensible, and that the only sound interpretation of the

constitution is that avowed upon its adoption; that is to say, that the

power of removal belongs to the appointing power.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1538.
 </b>
 Whether the predictions of the original advocates of the

executive

power, or those of the opposers of it, are likely, in the future progress

of the government, to be realized, must be left to the sober judgment of

the community, and to the impartial award of time.  If there has been any

aberration from the true constitutional exposition of the power of removal,

(which the reader must decide for himself,) it will be difficult, and

perhaps impracticable, after forty years experience, to recall the practice

to the correct theory. But at all events, it will be a consolation to

those, who love the Union, and honour a devotion to the patriotic discharge

of duty, that in regard to "inferior officers," (which appellation probably

includes ninety-nine out of a hundred of the lucrative offices in the

government,) the remedy for any permanent abuse is still within the power

of congress, by the simple expedient of requiring the consent of the senate

to removals in such cases.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1539.
 </b>
 Another point of great practical importance is, when the

appointment of any officer is to be deemed complete.  It will be seen in a

succeeding clause, that the president is to "commission all the officers of

the United States."  In regard to officers, who are removable at the will

of the executive, the. point is unimportant, since they may be displaced,

and their commission arrested at any moment.  But if the officer is not so

removable, the time, when the appointment is complete, becomes of very deep

interest.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1540.
 </b>
 This subject was very elaborately discussed in the

celebrated case

of Marbury v. Madison.
 <sup>
  <a href="#103">
   103
  </a>
 </sup>
 Marbury had been appointed a justice of the peace

of the
</p>
<p>
 District of Columbia for five years, according to an act of congress, by

President Adams, by and with the consent of the senate.  His commission had

been signed by the president, and was sealed, and deposited in the

department of state at the time of Mr. Jefferson's accession to the

presidency; and was afterwards withheld from him by the direction of the

latter.  An act of congress had directed  the secretary of state to keep

the seal of the United States; and to make out, and record, and affix the

seal to all civil commissions to officers of the United States, to be

appointed by the president, after he should have signed the same. Upon the

fullest deliberation, the court were of opinion, that, when a commission

has been signed by the president, the appointment is final and complete.

The officer appointed has, then, conferred on him legal rights, which

cannot be resumed.  Until that, the discretion of the president may be

exercised by him, as to the appointment; but, from that moment, it is

irrevocable.  His power over the office is then terminated in all cases,

where by law the officer is not removable by him.  The right tothe office

is then in the person appointed, and he has the absolute, unconditional

power of accepting, or rejecting it.  Neither a delivery of the commission,

nor an actual acceptance of the office, is indispensable to make the

appointment perfect.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1541.
 </b>
 The reasoning, upon which this doctrine is founded,

cannot be

better elucidated, than by using the very language of the opinion, in which

it is promulgated.  After quoting the words of the constitution, and laws

above referred to, it proceeds as follows:
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1542.
 </b>
 "These are the clauses of the constitution and laws of

the United

States, which affect this part of
</p>
<p>
 the case.  They seem to contemplate three distinct operations: (l.) The

nomination.  This is the sole act of the president, and is completely

voluntary.  (2.) The appointment.  This is also the act of the president;

and is also a voluntary act, though it can only be performed by and with

the advice and consent of the senate.  (3.) The commission.  To grant a

commission to a person appointed, might perhaps be deemed a duty enjoined

by the constitution.   'He shall,' says that instrument, 'commission all

the officers of the United States.'  The acts of appointing to office, and

commissioning the person appointed, can scarcely be considered as one and

the same; since the power to perform them is given in two separate and

distinct sections of the constitution.  The distinction between the

appointment and the commission will be rendered more apparent, by adverting

to that provision in the second section of the second article of the

constitution, which authorizes congress 'to vest, by law, the appointment

of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the president alone, in

the courts of law, or in the heads of departments;' thus contemplating

cases, where the law may direct the president to commission an officer

appointed by the courts, or by the heads of departments.  In such a case,

to issue a commission would be apparently a duty distinct from the

appointment, the performance of which, perhaps, could not legally be

refused.  Although that clause of the constitution, which requires the

president to commission all the officers of the United States, may never

have been applied to officers appointed otherwise, than by himself; yet it

would be difficult to deny the legislative power to apply it to such cases.

Of consequence the constitutional distinction between the appointment to
</p>
<p>
 an office, and the commission of an officer, who has been appointed,

remains the same, as if in practice the president had commissioned officers

appointed by an authority, other than his own.  It follows, too, from the

existence of this distinction, that, if an appointment was to be evidenced

by any public act, other than the commission, the performance of such

public act would create the officer; and, if he was not removable at the

will of the president, would either give him a right to his commission, or

enable him to perform the duties without it.  These observations are

premised solely for the purpose of rendering more intelligible those, which

apply more directly to the particular case under consideration.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1543.
 </b>
 "This is an appointment made by the president, by and

with the

advice and consent of the senate, and is evidenced by no act but the

commission itself. In such a case, therefore, the commission and the

appointment seem inseparable; it being almost impossible to show an

appointment otherwise, than by proving the existence of a commission.

Still the commission is not necessarily the appointment; though conclusive

evidence of it.  But at what stage does it amount to this conclusive

evidence?  The answer to this question seems an obvious one.  The

appointment, being the sole act of the president, must be completely

evidenced, when it is shown, that he has done every thing to be performed

by him.  Should the commission, instead of being evidence of an

appointment, even be considered as constituting the appointment itself;

still, it would be made, when the last act to be done by the president was

performed, or at farthest, when the commission was complete.  The last act

to be done by the president, is the signature of the commission.
</p>
<p>
 He has then acted on the advice and consent of the senate to his own

nomination.  The time for deliberation has then passed. He has decided. His

judgment, on the advice and consent of the senate concurring with his

nomination, has been made, and the officer is appointed. This appointment

is evidenced by an open, unequivocal act; and being the last act required

from the person making it, necessarily excludes the idea of its being, so

far as respects the appointment, an inchoate and incomplete transaction.

Some point of time must be taken, when the power of the executive over .an

officer, not removable at his will, must cease.  That point of time must

be, when the constitutional power of appointment has been exercised.  And

this power has been exercised, when the last act, required from the person

possessing the power, has been performed. This last act is the signature of

the commission.  This idea seems to have prevailed with the legislature,

when the act passed, converting the department of foreign affairs into the

department of state.  By that act it is enacted, that the secretary of

state shall keep the seal of the United States, 'and shall make out and

record, and shall affix the said seal to all civil commissions to officers

of the United States, to be appointed by the president:' 'Provided, that

the said seal shall not be affixed to any commission, before the same shall

have been signed by the president of the United States; nor to any other

instrument or act, without the special warrant of the president therefor.'

The signature is a warrant for affixing the great seal to the commission;

and the great seal is only to be affixed to an instrument, which is

complete.  It attests, by an act supposed to be of public notoriety, the

verity of the presidential signature.  It is never to be affixed, till the

commission
</p>
<p>
 all the weight, which it appears possible to give them, is signed, because

the signature, which gives force and effect to the commission, is

conclusive evidence, that the appointment is made.  The commission being

signed, the subsequent duty of the secretary of state is prescribed by law,

and not to be guided by the will of the president.  He is to affix the seal

of the United States to the commission, and is to record it.  This is not a

proceeding, which may be varied, if the judgment of the executive shall

suggest one more eligible; but is a precise course accurately marked out by

law, and is to be strictly pursued.  It is the duty of the secretary of

state to conform to the law, and in this he is an officer of the United

States, bound to obey the laws. He acts, in this respect, as has been very

properly stated at the bar, under the authority of law, and not by the

instructions of the president.  It is a ministerial act, which the law

enjoins on a particular officer for a particular purpose.  If it should be

supposed, that the solemnity of affixing the seal is necessary, not only to

the validity of the commission, but even to the completion of an

appointment; still, when the seal is affixed, the appointment is made, and

the commission is valid.  No other solemnity is required by law; no other

act is to be performed on the part of government. All, that the executive

can do to invest the person with his office, is done; and unless the

appointment be then made, the executive cannot make one without the

cooperation of others.  After searching anxiously for the principles, on

which a contrary opinion may be supported, none have been found, which

appear of sufficient force to maintain the opposite doctrine.  Such, as the

imagination of the court could suggest, have been very deliberately

examined, and after allowing them
</p>
<p>
 they do not shake the opinion, which has been formed.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1544.
 </b>
 "In considering this question, it has been

conjectured, that the

commission may have been assimilated to a deed, to the validity of which

delivery is essential.  This idea is founded on the supposition, that the

commission is not merely evidence of an appointment, but is itself the

actual appointment; a supposition by no means unquestionable.  But, for the

purpose of examining this objection fairly, let it be conceded, that the

principle claimed for its support is established.  The appointment being,

under the constitution, to be made by the president personally, the

delivery of the deed of appointment, if necessary to its completion, must

be made by the president also.  It is not necessary, that the livery should

be made personally to the grantee of the office.  It never is so made. The

law would seem to contemplate, that it should be made to the secretary of

state, since it directs the secretary to affix the seal to the commission,

after it shall have been signed by the president.  If, then, the act of

livery be necessary to give validity to the commission, is has been

delivered, when executed and given to the secretary for the purpose of

being sealed, recorded, and transmitted to the party.  But in all cases of

letters patent, certain  solemnities are  required by law, which

solemnities are the evidences of the validity of the instrument.  A formal

delivery to the person is not among them.  In cases of commissions the sign

manual of the president, and the seal of the United States, are those

solemnities.  This objection, therefore, does not touch the case.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1545.
 </b>
 "It has also occurred, as possible, and barely

possible, that the

transmission of the commission, and
</p>
<p>
 the acceptance thereof, might be deemed necessary to complete the right of

the plaintiff.  The transmission of the commission is a practice directed

by convenience, but not by law.  It cannot therefore be necessary to

constitute the appointment, which must precede it, and which is the mere

act of the president.  If the executive required, that every person,

appointed to an office, should himself take means to procure his

commission, the appointment would not be the less valid on that account.

The appointment is the sole act of the president; the transmission of the

commission is the sole act of the officer, to whom that duty is assigned,

and may be accelerated, or retarded by circumstances, which canhave no

influence on the appointment.  A commission is transmitted to a person

already appointed; not to a person to be appointed, or not, as the letter

enclosing the commission should happen to get into the post-office, and

reach him in safety, or to miscarry.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1546.
 </b>
 "It may have some tendency to elucidate this point, to

inquire,

whether the possession of the original commission be indispensably

necessary to authorize a person, appointed to any office, to perform the

duties of that office.  If it was necessary, then a loss of the commission

would lose the office.  Not only negligence, but accident or fraud, fire or

theft, might deprive an individual of his office.  In such a case, I

presume, it could not be doubted, but that a copy from the record of the

office of the secretary of state would be, to every intent and purpose,

equal to the original. The act of congress has expressly made it so.  To

give that copy validity, it would not he necessary to prove, that the

original had been transmitted, and afterwards lost.  The copy would be

complete evidence, that the
</p>
<p>
 original had existed, and that the appointment had been made; but, not that

the original had been transmitted.  If, indeed, it should appear, that the

original had been mislaid in the office of state, that circumstance would

not affect the operation of the copy. When all the requisites have been

performed, which authorize a recording officer to record any instrument

whatever, and the order for that purpose has been given, the instrument is,

in law, considered as recorded, although the manual labour of inserting it

in a book kept for that purpose may not have been performed. In the ease of

commissions, the law orders the secretary of state to record them.  When,

therefore, they are signed and sealed, the order for their being recorded

is given; and whether inserted in the book, or not, they are in law

recorded.  A copy of this record is declared equal to the original, and the

fees, to be paid by a person requiring a copy, are ascertained by law.  Can

a keeper of a public record erase therefrom a commission, which has been

recorded?  Or can he refuse a copy thereof to a person demanding it on the

terms prescribed by law?  Such a copy would, equally with the original,

authorize the justice of peace to proceed in the performance of his duty,

because it would, equally with the original, attest his appointment.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1547.
 </b>
 "If the transmission of a commission be not considered, as

necessary to give validity to an appointment, still less is its acceptance.

The appointment is the sole act of the president; the acceptance is the

sole act of the officer, and is, in plain common sense, posterior to the

appointment.  As he may resign, so may he refuse to accept.  But neither

the one, nor the other, is capable of rendering the appointment a

nonentity.  That this is the understanding of the govern-
</p>
<p>
 ment is apparent from the whole tenor of its conduct. A commission bears

date, and the salary of the officer commences, from his appointment; not

from the transmission, or acceptance of his commission.  When a person,

appointed to any office, refuses to accept that office, the successor is

nominated in the place of the person, who has declined to accept, and not

in the place of the person, who had been previously in office, and had

created the original vacancy.  It is, therefore, decidedly the opinion of

the court, that, when a commission has been signed by the president, the

appointment is made; and that the commission is complete, when the seal of

the United States has been affixed to it by the secretary of state.  Where

an officer is removable at the will of the executive, the circumstance,

which completes his appointment, is of no concern; because the act is at

any time revocable; and the commission may be arrested, if still in the

office.  But when the officer is not removable at the will of the

executive, the appointment is not revocable, and cannot be annulled.  It

has conferred legal rights, which cannot be resumed.  The discretion of the

executive is to be exercised, until the appointment has been made. But

having once made the appointment, his power over the office is terminated

in all cases, where, by law, the officer is not removable by him.  The

right to the office is then in the person appointed, and he has the

absolute, unconditional power of accepting or rejecting it.  Mr. Marbury,

then, since his commission was signed by the president, and sealed by the

secretary of state, was appointed; and as the law, creating the office,

gave the officer a right to hold for five years, independent of the

executive; the appointment was not revocable but vested in the officer

legal rights, which
</p>
<p>
 are protected by the laws of his country.  To withhold his commission,

therefore, is an act deemed by the court not warranted by law, but

violative of a vested legal right."

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1548.
 </b>
 Another question, growing out of appointments, is, at

what time

the appointee is to be deemed in office, whether from the time of his

acceptance of the office, or his complying with the preliminary

requisitions, (such, as taking the oath of office, giving bond for the

faithful discharge of his duties, &amp;c.) orhis actual entry upon the duties

of his office.  This question may become of great practical importance in

eases of removals from office, and also in cases, where by law officers are

appointed for a limited term.  It frequently happens, that no formal

removal from office is made by the president, except by nominating another

person to the senate, in place of the person removed, and without any

notice to him.  In such a case, is the actual incumbent in office de facto

removed immediately upon the nomination of a new officer?  If so, then all

his subsequent acts in the office are void, though he may have no notice of

the nomination, and may, from the delay to give such notice, go on for a

month to perform its functions.  Is the removal to be deemed complete only,

when the nomination has been confirmed?  Or, when notice is actually given

to the incumbent? Or, when the. appointee has accepted the
</p>
<p>
 office?
 <sup>
  <a href="#105">
   105
  </a>
 </sup>
 Hitherto this point does not seem to have received any judicial

decision, and therefore must be treated as open to controversy.  If the

decision should be, that in such cases the nomination without notice

creates a removal de facto, as well as de jure, it is obvious, that the

public, as well as private individuals, may become sufferers by

unintentional and innocent violations of law.  A collector, for instance,

may receive duties, may grant clearances to vessels, and may perform other

functions of the office for months after such a nomination, without the

slightest suspicion of any want of legal authority.  Upon one occasion it

was said by the Supreme Court, that "when a person appointed to any office

(under the United States) refuses to accept that office, the successor is

nominated in the place of the person, who has declined to accept, and not

in the place of the person, who had been previously in office, and had

created the original vacancy."
 <sup>
  <a href="#106">
   106
  </a>
 </sup>
 From this remark, it would seem to be the

opinion of the court, that the office is completely filled in every case of

vacancy, as soon as the appointment is complete; independently of the

acceptance of the appointee.  If so, it would seem to follow, that the

removal must, at all events, be complete, as soon as a new appointment is

made.

 One of the most extraordinary instances of a perverse intention to

misrepresent, and thereby to render odious the constitution, was in the

president to fill vacancies in the senate itself, occurring during the

recess;
 <sup>
  <a href="#109">
   109

 </sup>
 a power; which, in another clause of the constitution, was

expressly confided to the state executive.  It is wholly unnecessary,

however, now to dwell upon this preposterous suggestion, since it does. not

admit of a doubt, that the power given to the president is applicable

solely to appointments to offices under the United States, provided for by

the constitution and laws of the Union. It is only another proof of the

gross exaggerations, and. unfounded alarms; which were constantly resorted

to for the purpose of defeating a system, which could scarcely fail of

general approbation, if it was fairly understood.

<p>
 <b>
  § 1551.
 </b>
 The propriety of this grant is so obvious, that it can

require no

elucidation.  There was but one of two courses to be adopted; either, that

the senate should be perpetually in session, in order to provide for the

appointment of officers; or, that the president should be authorized to

make temporary appointments during the recess, which should expire, when

the senate should have had an opportunity to act on the subject. The former

course would have been at once burthensome to the senate, and expensive to

the public.  The latter combines convenience, promptitude of action, and

general security.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1552.
 </b>
 The appointments so made, by the very language of the

constitution, expire at the next session of the senate; and the commissions

given by him have the same duration.  When the senate is assembled, if the

president nominates the same officer to the office, this is to all intents

and purposes a new nomination to office; and, if approved by the senate,

the appointment is a new appointment, and not a mere continuation of the

old appointment.  So that, if a bond for fidelity in office has been given

under the first appointment and commission, it does not apply to any acts

done under the new appointment and commission.
 <sup>
  <a href="#111">

 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1553.
 </b>
 The language of the clause is, that the president

shall have power

to fill up vacancies, that may happen during the recess of the senate.  In

1813, President Madison appointed and commissioned ministers to negotiate

the treaty of peace of Ghent during the recess of the senate; and a

question was made, whether he had a constitutional authority so to do,

there being no vacancy of any existing office; but this being the creation

of a new office.  The senate, at their next session, are said to have

entered a protest against such an exercise of power by the executive.  On a

subsequent occasion, (April 20, 1822,) the senate seem distinctly to have

held, that the president could not create the office of minister, and make

appointments to such an office during the recess, without the consent of

the senate.  By "vacancies" they understood to be meant vacancies occurring

from death, resignation, promotion, or removal.  The word "happen" had

relation to some casualty, not provided for by law.  If the senate are in

session, when offices are created by law, which have not as yet been

filled, and
</p>
<p>
 nominations are not then made to them by the president, he cannot appoint

to such offices during the recess of the senate, because the vacancy does

not happen during the recess of the senate.  In many instances, where

offices are created by law, special power is on this very account given to

the president to fill them during the recess; and it was then said, that in

no other instances had the president filled such vacant offices without the

special authority of law.

 <b>
  § 1554.
 </b>
 The next section of the second article is, "He (the

president)

shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of

the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures, as he shall

judge necessary and expedient.  He may, on extraordinary occasions, convene

both houses, or either of them, and, in case of a disagreement between

them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such

time, as he shall think proper. He shall receive ambassadors, and other

public ministers.  He shall take care, that the laws be faithfully

executed; and shall commission all the officers of the United States."
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1555.
 </b>
 The first part, relative to the president's giving

information and

recommending measures to congress, is so consonant with the structure of

the executive departments of the colonial,  and state governments, with the

usages and practice of other free governments, with the general convenience

of congress, and with a due share of responsibility on the part of the

executive, that it may well be presumed to be above all real objection.

From the nature and duties of the executive department, he must possess

more extensive sources of
</p>
<p>
 information, as well in regard to domestic as foreign affairs, than can

belong to congress.  The true workings of the laws; the defects in the

nature or arrangements of the general systems of trade, finance, and

justice; and the military, naval, and civil establishments of the Union,

are more readily seen, and more constantly under the view of the executive,

than they can possibly be of any other department.  There is great wisdom,

therefore, in not merely allowing, but in requiring, the president to lay

before congress all facts and information, which may assist their

deliberations; and in enabling him at once to point out the evil, and to

suggest the remedy.  He is thus justly made responsible, not merely for a

due administration of the existing systems, but for due diligence and

examination into the means of improving them.

 On the other hand, the duty imposed upon him to take

care, that

the laws be faithfully executed, follows out the strong injunctions of his

oath of office, that he will "preserve, protect, and defend the

constitution."  The great object of the executive department is to

accomplish this purpose; and without it, be the form of government whatever

it may, it will be utterly worthless for offence, or defence; for the

redress of grievances, or the protection of rights; for the happiness, or

good order, or safety of the people.
</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1559.
 </b>
 The next power is to receive ambassadors and other public

ministers.  This has been already incidentally touched.  A similar power

existed under the confederation; but it was confined to receiving

"ambassadors," which word, in a strict sense, (as has been already

started,) comprehends the highest grade only of ministers, and not those of

an inferior character. The policy of the United States would ordinarily

prefer the employment of the inferior grades; and therefore the description

is properly enlarged, so as to include all classes of ministers.
 <sup>
  <a href="#116">
   116
  </a>
 </sup>
 Why the

receiving of consuls
</p>
<p>
 was not also expressly mentioned, as the appointment of them is in the

preceding clause, is not easily to be accounted for, especially as the

defect of the confederation on this head was fully understood.
 <sup>
  <a href="#117">
   117
  </a>
 </sup>
 The power,

however, may be fairly inferred from other parts of the constitution; and

indeed seems a general incident to the executive authority.  It has

constantly been exercised without objection; and foreign consuls have never

beer allowed to discharge any functions of office, until they have received

the exequatur of the president.
 <sup>
  <a href="#118">
   118

 Consuls, indeed, are not diplomatic

functionaries, or political representatives of a foreign nation; but are

treated in the character of mere commercial agents.

</p>
<p>
 <b>
  § 1560.
 </b>
 The power to receive ambassadors and ministers is always an

important, and sometimes a very delicate function; since it constitutes the

only accredited medium, through which negotiations and friendly relations

are ordinarily carried on with foreign powers.  A government may in its

discretion lawfully refuse to receive an ambassador, or other minister,

without its affording any just cause of war.  But it would generally be

deemed an unfriendly act, and might provoke hostilities, unless accompanied

by conciliatory explanations. A refusal is sometimes made on the ground of

the bad character of the minister, or his former offensive conduct, or of

the special subject of the embassy not being proper, or convenient for

discussion.
 <sup>
  <a href="#120">
   120
  </a>
 </sup>
 This, however, is rarely done.  But a much more delicate

occasion is,
</p>
<p>
 when a civil war breaks-out in a nation, and two nations are formed, or two

parties in the same nation, each claiming the sovereignty of the whole, and

the contest remains as yet undecided, flagrante bello.  In such a case a

neutral nation may very properly withhold its recognition of the. supremacy

of either party, or of the existence of two independent nations; and on

that account refuse to receive an ambassador from either.
 <sup>
  <a href="#121">
   121
  </a>
 </sup>
 It is obvious,

that in such cases the simple acknowledgment of the minister of either

party, or nation, might be deemed taking part against the other; and thus

as affording a strong countenance, or opposition, to rebellion and civil

dismemberment.  On this account, nations, placed in such a predicament,

have not hesitated sometimes to declare war against neutrals, as

interposing in the war; and have made them the victims of their vengeance,

when they have been anxious to assume a neutral position.  The exercise of

this prerogative of acknowledging new nations, or ministers, is, therefore,

under such circumstances, an executive function of great delicacy, which

requires the utmost caution and deliberation. If the executive receives an

ambassador, or other minister, as the representative of a new nation, or of

a party in a civil war in an old nation, it is an acknowledgment of the

sovereign authority de facto of such new nation, or party.  If such

recognition is made, it is conclusive upon the nation, unless indeed it can

be reversed by an act of congress repudiating it.  If, on the other hand,

such recognition has been refused by the executive, it is said, that

congress may, notwithstanding, solemnly
</p>
<p>
 acknowledge the sovereignty of the nation, or party.
 <sup>
  <a href="#122">
   122
  </a>
 </sup>
 These, however, are

propositions, which have hitherto remained, as abstract statements, under

the constitution; and, therefore, can be propounded, not as absolutely

true, but as still open to discussion, if they should ever arise in the

course of our foreign diplomacy.  The constitution has expressly invested

the executive with power to receive ambassadors, and other ministers.  It

has not expressly invested congress with the power, either to repudiate, or

acknowledge them.
 <sup>
  <a href="#123">
   123

 </sup>
 At all events, in the case of a revolution, or

dismemberment of a nation, the judiciary cannot take notice of any new

government, or sovereignty, until it has been duly recognised by some other

department of the government, to whom the power is constitutionally

confided.

 That a power, so extensive in its reach over our foreign

relations, could not be properly conferred on any other, than the executive

department, will admit of little doubt.  That it should be exclusively

confided to that department, without any participation of the senate in the

functions, (that body being conjointly entrusted with the treaty-making

power,) is
</p>
<p>
 not so obvious.  Probably the circumstance, that in all foreign

governments1 the power was exclusively confided to the executive

 It is not, indeed, a power likely to be abused; though

it is pregnant with consequences, often involving the question of peace and

war.  And, in our own short experience, the revolutions in France, and the

revolutions in South America, have already placed us in situations, to feel

its critical character, and the necessity of having, at the head of the

government, an executive of sober judgment, enlightened views, and firm and

exalted patriotism.3

  § 1562.
 </b>
 As incidents to the power to receive ambassadors and

foreign

ministers, the president is understood to possess the power to refuse them,

and to dismiss those who, having been received, become obnoxious to

censure, or unfit to be allowed the privilege, by their improper conduct,

or by political events.

  § 1563.
 </b>
 There are other incidental powers, belonging to the

executive

department, which are necessarily implied from the nature of the functions,

which are
</p>
<p>
 confided to it.  Among these, must necessarily be included the power to

perform them, without any obstruction or impediment whatsoever.  The

president cannot, therefore, be liable to arrest, imprisonment, or

detention, while he is in the discharge of the duties of his office; and

for this purpose his person must be deemed, in civil cases at least, to

possess an official inviolability.  In the exercise of his political powers

he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country,

and to his own conscience.  His decision, in relation to these powers, is

subject to no control; and his discretion, when exercised, is conclusive.

But he has no authority to control other officers of the government, in

relation to the duties imposed upon them by law, in cases not touching his

political powers.

  § 1564.
 </b>
 In the year 1793, president Washington thought it his

duty to

issue a proclamation, forbidding the citizens of the United States to take

any part in the hostilities, then existing between Great Britain and

France; warning them against carrying goods, contraband of war; and

enjoining upon them an entire abstinence from all acts, inconsistent with

the duties of neutrality.
 <sup>
  <a href="#130">

 This proclamation had the unanimous approbation

of his cabinet.
 <sup>
  <a href="#131">
   131

 Being, however, at variance with the popular passions.

and prejudices of the day, this exercise of incidental authority was

assailed with uncommon vehemence, and was denied to be constitutional.  It

seems wholly unnecessary now to review
</p>
<p>
 the grounds of the controversy, since the deliberate sense of.the nation

has gone along with the exercise of the power, as one properly belonging to

the executive duties.
 <sup>
  <a href="#132">

 </sup>
 If the President is bound to see to the execution

of the laws, and treaties of the United States; and if the duties of

neutrality, when the nation has not assumed a belligerent attitude, are by

the law of nations obligatory upon it, it seems. difficult to perceive any

solid objection to a proclamation, stating the facts, and admonishing the

citizens of their own duties and responsibilities.

 We have seen, that by law the president possesses the

right to

require the written advice and opinions of his cabinet ministers; upon all

questions connected with their respective departments.  But, he does not

possess a like authority, in regard to the judicial department.  That

branch of the government can be called upon only to decide controversies,

brought before them in a legal form; and therefore are bound to abstain

from any extra-judicial opinions upon points of law, even though solemnly

requested by the executive.

 The remaining section of the fourth article, declaring

that the

President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the United States

shall be liable to impeachment, has been already fully considered in

another place.  And thus is closed the examination of the rights, powers,

and duties of the executive department. Unless my judgment has been unduly

biassed, I think it will be found impossible to hold from this part of the

constitution a tribute of profound respect, if not of the liveliest

admiration.  All, that seems desirable in order to gratify the hopes,

secure the reverence, and sustain the dignity of the nation, is, that it

should always be occupied by a man of elevated talents, of ripe virtues, of

incorruptible integrity, and of tried patriotism; one, who shall forget his

own interests, and remember, that he represents not a party, but the whole

nation; one, whose fame may be rested with posterity, not upon the false

eulogies of favourites, but upon the solid merit of having preserved the

glory, and enhanced the prosperity of the country.

<li><a id="9"></a> During the war with Great Britain in 1812, it was questioned, whether

the president could delegate his right to command the militia, by

authorizing another officer to command them, when they were called into the

public service.  (8 Mass, Reports, 548, 550.) If he cannot, this

extraordinary result would follow, that if different detachment, of militia  were called out, he could not, except in person, command any of them; and

if they were to act together, no officer could be appointed to command them

in his absence.  In the Pennsylvania insurrection, in 1794, President

Washington called out the militia of the adjacent states of New Jersey,

Maryland, and Virginia, as well as of Pennsylvania, and all the troops, so

called out, acted under the orders of the governor of Virginia, on whom the

president conferred the chief command during his absence.  Rawle on the

Const. ch. 20, p. 193.  It was a practical affirmation of the authority,

<li><a id="11"></a> Mr. Jefferson has informed us, that in Washington's administration, for

measures of importance, or difficulty. a consultation was held with the

heads of the departments, either assembled, or by taking their opinions

separately in conversation, or in writing. In his own administration, he

followed the practice of assembling the heads of departments, as a cabinet

council.  But he has added, that he thinks the course of requiring the

separate opinion in writing of each bead of a department is most strictly

in the spirit of the constitution; for the other does, in fact, transform

the executive into a directory. 4 Jefferson's Corresp. 143, 144.</li>

"Were it possible," says he "in every instance, to maintain a just

testimony and the mode of trial so perfect, as to preclude mistake, or

injustice, there would be some colour for the admission of this

(Beccaria's) plausible theory.  But even in that case policy would

sometimes require a remission of a punishment, strictly due for a crime

certainly ascertained.  The very notion of mercy implies the accuracy of

the claims of justice."*  What should we say of a government, which

purported to act upon mere human justice, excluding all opera- * Kent's Comm. Lect. 13, p. 265.  tions of mercy in all cases?  An inexorable government would scarcely be

more praiseworthy, than a despotism.  It would be intolerable and

treaties, it is common for the senate to require, and. for the president to

lay before them, all the official documents respecting the negotiations, to

assist their judgment.  But the house of representatives have no

constitutional right to insist on the production of them; and it is matter

of discretion with the president, whether to comply, or not, with the

demand of the house, which is but in the nature of a request.  In the case

of the British Treaty of 1794, President Washington refused to lay the

papers before the house of representatives, when requested by them so to

do.  See his Massager 24th of March, 1796; 1 Tuck. Black. Comm. App. 334; 5

Marshall's Life of Washington, ch. 8, p. 654; 4 Jefferson's Corresp. 464,

465; Rawle on Const. ch. 16, p. 171. In the early part of President Washington's administration, he

occasionally met the senate in person, to confer with them on the executive

business confided to them by the constitution.  But this practice was found

very inconvenient, and was soon abandoned.  In June, 1853, the senate

appointed a committee to hold a conference with President Madison,

respecting his nomination of a minister to Sweden, then before them for

ratification.  Bat he declined it, considering, that it was incompatible

with the due relations between the executive, and other departments of the

government*  It is believed,that the practice has been ever since

abandoned. Mr. Jefferson and the cabinet, (with tile exception of Mr. Hamilton,) in

President Washington's administration, seem to have been of opinion, that

neither branch of the legislature had a right to call upon the heads of

departments, except through calls on the president for information or

papers.  (4 Jefferson's 'Corresp. 463, 461, 465.)  The practice has,

however, of late years, settled down in favour of making direct calls on

the heads of the departments.  Rawle on Const. ch. 16, p. 171, 172. * Sergeant on Const. ch. 31, (2d edition,) p. 371; 5 Niles's Register,

<li><a id="82"></a> A practical question of some importance arose soon after the

constitution was adopted, in regard to the appointment of foreign

ministers; whether tim power of the senate over the appointment gave that

body a right to inquire into the policy of making any such appointment, or

instituting any mission; or whether their power was confined to the

consideration of the mere fitness of the person nominated for the office.

If the former were the true interpretation of the senatorial authority,

then they would have a right to inquire into the motives, which should

induce the president to create such a diplomatic mission. It was after

debate decided by a small majority of the senate, in 1792, that they had no

right to enter upon the consideration of the policy, or fitness of the

mission. 5 Marshall's Life of Washington, ch. 5, p. 370, note.  But the

senate have on several occasions since that time decided the other way; and

particularly in regard to missions to Russia and Turkey.</li>
<li><a id="83"></a> The Federalist, No. 77.</li>
<li><a id="84"></a> Whether the senate should have a negative on presidential appointments,

was a question, upon which the members of the convention were much divided.

Mr. John Adams (afterwards president) was opposed to it; and a friendly

correspondence took place between him and Mr. Roger Sherman, of

Connecticut. (one of the framers of the constitution,) upon the subject.  I

extract from Mr. Pitkin's valuable History of the United States, the

substance of the arguments urged on each side, as they present a general

view of the reasoning, which had influence in the convention. "To some general observations of Mr. Sherman in favour of this power in

the senate, Mr. Adams made the following objections. "'The negative of the senate upon appointments,' he said 'is liable to the

following objections. "'1. It takes away, or at least it lessens the responsibility of the

executive -- our constitution obliges me to say, that it lessens the

responsibility of the president.  The blame of an hasty, injudicious, weak,

or wicked appointment, is shared so much between him and the senate, that

his part of it will be too small.  Who can censure him, without censuring

the senate, and the legislatures who appoint them? all their friends will

be interested to vindicate the president, in order to screen them from

censure; besides, if an impeachment is brought before them against an

officer, are they not interested to acquit him, lest some part of the odium

of his guilt should fall upon them, who advised to his appointment? "'2. It turns the minds and attention of the people to the senate, a

branch of the legislature, in executive matters; it interests another

branch of the legislature in the management of the executive; it divides

the people between the executive sad the senate: whereas all the people

ought to be united to watch the executive, to oppose its encroachments, and

resist its ambition.  Senators and representatives, and their

constituents--in short, the aristocratical and democratical divisions of

society, ought to be united, on all occasions, to oppose the executive or

the monarchical branch, when it attempts to overleap its limits.  But how

can this union be effected, when the aristocratical branch has pledged its

reputation to the executive by consenting to an appointment? "'3. It has a natural tendency, to excite ambition in the senate.  An

active. ardent spirit, in that house, who is rich, and able, has a great

reputation and influence, will be solicited by candidates for office; not

to introduce the idea of bribery, because, though it certainly would force

itself in, in other countries, and will probably here, when we  grow populous and rich, yet it is not yet, I hope, to be dreaded.  But

ambition must come in, already.  A senator of great influence will be

naturally ambitious, and desirous of increasing his influence.  Will he not

be under a temptation to use his influence with the president, as well as

his brother senators, to appoint persons to office in the several states,

who will exert themselves in elections to get out his enemies or opposers,

both in senate and house of representatives, and to get in his friends,

perhaps his instruments?  Suppose a senator, to aim at the treasury office,

for himself, his brother, father, or son.  Suppose him to aim at the

president's chair, or vice-president's, at the next election -- or at the

office of war, foreign or domestic affairs, will he not naturally be

tempted to make use of his whole patronage, his whole influence, in

advising to appointments, both with president and senators, to get such

persons nominated, as will exert themselves in elections of president,

vice-president, senators, and house of representatives, to increase his

interests, and promote his views? In this point of view, I am very

apprehensive, that this defect in our constitution will have an unhappy

tendency to introduce corruption of the grossest kinds, both of ambition

and avarice, into all our elections.  And this will be the worst of poisons

to our constitution; it will not only destroy the present form of

government, but render it almost impossible to substitute in its place any

free government, even a better limited monarchy, or any other, than a

despotism, or a simple monarchy. "'4. To avoid the evil under the last head, it will be in danger of

dividing the continent into two or three nations, a case that presents no

prospect but of perpetual war. "' 5.  This negative on appointments is in danger of involving the senate

in reproach, obloquy, censure, and suspicion, without doing any good.  Will

the senate use their negative or not? -- if not, why should they have it?

-- many will censure them for not using it -- many will ridicule them, call

them servile, &amp;c., if they do use it.  The very first instance of it will

expose the senators to the resentment, not only of the disappointed

candidate and all his friends, but of the president and all his friends;

and those will be most of the officers of government, through the nation. "'6. We shall very soon have parties formed -- a court and country party

-- and these parties will have names given them; one party in the house of

representatives will support the president and his measures and ministers

-- the other will oppose them -- a similar party will be in the senate --

these parties will struggle with all their art, perhaps with intrigue,

perhaps with corruption at every election to increase their own  friends, and diminish their opposers.  Suppose such parties formed in the

senate, and then consider what factions, divisions, we shall have there,

upon every nomination. "' 7. The senate have not time.  You are of opinion, "that the concurrence

of the senate in the appointment to office will strengthen the bands of the

executive, and secure the confidence of the people, much better than a

select council, and will be less expensive," but in every one of these

ideas, I have the misfortune to differ from you.  It will weaken the hands

of the executive, by lessening the obligation, gratitude, and attachment of

the candidate to the president, by dividing his attachment between the

executive and legislature, which are natural enemies. "'Officers of government, instead of having a single eye, and undivided

attachment to the executive branch, as they ought to have, consistent with

law and the constitution, will be constantly tempted to be factious with

their factious patrons in the senate.  The president's own officers, in a

thousand instances, will oppose his just and constitutional exertions, and

screen themselves under the wings of their patrons and party in the

legislature.  Nor will it secure the confidence of the people; the people

will have more confidence in the executive, in executive matters, than in

the senate.  The people will be constantly jealous of factious schemes in

the senators to unduly influence the executive, and of corrupt bargains

between the senate and executive, to serve each other's private views.  The

people will also be jealous, that the influence of the senate will be

employed to conceal, connive, and defend guilt in executive officers,

instead of being a guard and watch upon them, and a terror to them -- a

council selected by the president himself, at his pleasure, from among the

senators, representatives, and nation at large, would be purely responsible

-- in that case, the senate, as a body, would not be compromised.  The

senate would be a terror to privy councillors -- its honor would never be

pledged to support any measure or instrument of the executive, beyond

justice, law, and the constitution.  Nor would a privy, council be more

expensive. The whole senate must now deliberate on every appointment, and,

if they ever find time for it, you will find that a great deal of time will

be required and consumed in thin service.  Then the president might have a

constant executive council; now he has none. "'I said, under the seventh head, that the senate would not have time.

You will find, that the whole business of this. government will be

infinitely delayed, by this negative of the senate on treaties and

appointments.  Indian treaties and consular conventions have been  already waiting for months, and the senate have not been able to find a

moment of time to attend to them; and this evil must constantly increase,

so that the senate must be constantly sitting, and must be paid as long as

they sit. "'But I have tired your patience.  Is there any truth or importance in

these broken hints and crude surmises, or hot?  To me they appear well

founded, and very important.' "To these remarks Mr. Sherman replied, that he esteemed 'the provision

made for appointments to office to be a matter of very great importance, on

which the liberties and safety of the people depended, nearly as much as on

legislation.  If that was vested in the president alone, he might render

himself despotic.  It was a saying of one of the kings of England, "that

while the king could appoint the bishops and judges, he might have what

religion and laws he pleased."  To give that observation its full effect,

they most hold their offices during his pleasure; by such appointments,

without control, a power might be gradually established, that would be more

formidable than a standing army. "'It appears to me, that the senate is the most important branch in the

government, for the aid and support of the executive, for securing the

rights of the individual states, the government of the United States, and

the liberties of the people.  The executive is not to execute its own will,

but the will of the legislature declared by the laws, and the senate, being

a branch of the legislature, will be disposed to accomplish that end, and

advise to such appointments, as will be most likely to effect it; from

their knowledge of the people in the several states, they can give the best

information who are qualified for office.  And they will, as you justly

observe, in some degree lessen his responsibility; yet, will he not have as

much remaining as he can well support? and may not their advice enable him

to make such judicious appointments, as to render responsibility less

necessary? no person can deserve censure, when he acts honestly according

to his best discretion. "'The senators, being chosen by the legislatures of the states, and

depending on them for re-election, will naturally be watchful to prevent

any infringement of the rights of the states.  And the government of the

United States being federal, and instituted by a number of sovereign states

for the better security of their rights, and advancement of their

interests, they may be considered as so many pillars to support it, and by

the exercise of the state governments, peace and good order may be

preserved in the places most remote from the seat of the federal

government, as well as at the centre.  "'I believe this will be a better balance to secure the government, than

three independent negatives would be. "'I think you admit, in your Defence of the Governments of the United

States, that even one branch might serve in .a diplomatic government, like

that of the Union; but I think the constitution is much improved by the

addition of another branch, and those of the executive and judiciary. This

seems to be an improvement on federal government, beyond what has been made

by any other states. I can see nothing in the constitution, that will tend

to its dissolution, except the article for making amendments. "'That the evils, that you suggest, may happen in consequence of the power

vested in the senate, to aid the executive, appears to me to be but barely

possible. The senators, from the provision made for their appointment, will

commonly be some of the most respectable citizens in the states, for wisdom

and probity, and superior to faction, intrigue, or low artifice to obtain

appointments for themselves, or their friends, and any attempts of that

kind would destroy their reputation with a free and enlightened people, and

so frustrate the end they would have in view.  Their being candidates for

re-election will probably be one of the most powerful motives (next to that

of their virtue) to fidelity in office, and by that means alone would they

hope for success.  "He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely," is the

saying of a divinely inspired writer--they will naturally have the

confidence of the people, as they will be chosen by their immediate

representatives, as well as from their characters, as men of wisdom and

integrity.  And I see not why all the branches of government should not

harmonize in promoting the great end of their institution. the good and

happiness of the people. "'The senators and representatives being eligible from the citizens at

large, and wealth not being a requisite qualification for either, they will

be persons nearly equal, as to wealth and other qualifications, so that

there seems not to be any principle tending to aristocracy; which, if I

understand the term, is a government by nobles, independent of the people,

which cannot take place with us, in either respect, without a total

subversion of the constitution.  I believe the more this provision of the

constitution is attended to, and experienced, the more the wisdom and

utility of it will appear.  As senators cannot hold any other office

themselves. they will not be influenced, in their advice to the president,

by interested motives. But it is said, they may have friends and kindred to

provide for; it is true they may, but when we consider their character and

situation, will they not be diffident of nominating a friend, or relative,

who may wish for an office, and be well qualified for it, lest it  should be suspected to proceed from partiality?  And will not their fellow

members have a degree of the same reluctance, lest it should be thought

they acted from friendship to a member of their body? so that their friends

and connexions would stand a worse chance, in proportion to their real

merit, than strangers.  But if the president was left to select a council

for himself, though he may be supposed to be actuated by the best motives

-- yet he would be surrounded by flatterers, who would assume the character

of friends and patriots, though they had no attachment to the public good,

no regard to the laws of their country, but influenced wholly by

self-interest, would wish to extend the power of the executive, in order to

increase their own; they would often advise him to dispense with laws, that

should thwart their schemes, and in excuse plead, that it was done from

necessity to promote the public good -- they will use their own influence;

induce the president to use his, to get laws repealed, or the constitution

altered, to extend his powers and prerogatives, under pretext of advancing

the public good, and gradually render the government a despotism.  This

seems to be according to the course of human affairs, and what may be

expected from the nature of things.  I think, that members of the

legislature would be most likely duly to execute the laws, both in the

executive and judiciary departments."*</li>

<li><a id="89"></a> Another question occurred upon carrying into effect the act of congress

of 1821, for reducing the military establishment.   President Monroe, on

that occasion, contended, that he had a right, in filling the original

vacancies in the artillery, and in the newly created office of adjutant

general, to place in them any officer belonging to the whole military

establishment, whether of the staff, or of the line.  "In filling original

vacancies," said he, "that is, offices newly created, it is my opinion,

that congress have no right, under the constitution, to impose any

restraint, by law, on the power granted to the president, so as to prevent

his making a free election for these offices from the whole body of his

fellow citizens." -- "If the law imposed such a restraint, it would be

void." -- "If the right of the president. to fill these original vacancies,

by the selection of officers from any branch of the whole military

establishment, was denied, he would be compelled to place in them officers

of the same grade, whose corps had been reduced, and they with them. The

effect, therefore, of the law, as to those appointments, would be to

legislate into office, men, who had been already legislated ,at of office,

taking from the president all agency in their appointment." -- (Message,

12th April, 1822; 1 Executive Journal, 286.)  The senate wholly disagreed

to this doctrine, contending, that, as congress possessed the power to make

rules and regulations for the land and naval forces, they had a right to

make any, which they thought would promote the public service.  This power

had been exercised from the foundation of the government, in respect to the

army and navy.  Congress have a right to fix the rule, as to promotions and

appointments.  Every promotion is a new appointment, and is submitted to

the senate for confirmation. Congress, in all reductions of the army, have

fixed the rules of reduction, and no executive had hitherto denied their

rightful power so to do, or hesitated to execute such rules, as had been

prescribed.  Sergeant on Const. ch. 29, (ch. 31.)</li>

<li><a id="102"></a> In proof of this statement, lest it should be questioned, it is proper

to say, that a list of removals (confessedly imperfect) between the 4th of

March, 1829, when President Jackson came into office, and the 4th of March,

1830, has been published, by which it appears, that, during that period,

there were removed, eight persons in the diplomatic corps; thirtysix in the

executive departments; and in the other civil departments including

consuls, marshals, district attorneys, collectors, and other officers of

the customs, registers and receivers, one hundred and ninetynine persons.

These officers include a very large proportion of all the most lucrative

offices under the national government.  Besides these, there were removals

in the post-office department, during the same period, of four hundred and

ninety-one persons.  (See Mr. Post-Master General Barry's Report of 24th of

March, 1830.) This statement will be found in the National Intelligence of

the 27th of Sept, 1832, with the names of the parties (except

post-masters;) and I am not aware, that it has ever been denied to be

correct.  It is impossible for me to vouch for its entire accuracy.  It is

not probable, that, from the first organization of the government, in 1789,

down to 1829, the aggregate of all the removals made amounted to one third

of this number.  In President Washington's administration of eight years,

only nine removals took place. See Mr. Clayton's Speech in the Senate, on

the 4th of March 1830.</li>

Constitution, ch. 29, [ch. 31.] -- The reasoning of thin opinion would seem

to be, in a judicial view, absolutely irresistible; and, as such, received

at the time a very general approbation from the profession. It was,

however, totally disregarded by President Jefferson, who, on this, as on

other occasions, placed his right of construing the constitution and laws,

as wholly above, and independent of judicial decision.  In his

correspondence, he repeatedly alluded to this subject, and endeavoured to

vindicate his conduct.  In one of his letters he says, "In the case of

Marbury and Madison, the federal judges declared, that commissions, signed

and sealed by the president, were valid, although not delivered. I deemed

delivery essential to complete a deed, which, as long as it remains in the

hands of the party, is, as yet, no deed; it is in posse only, but not in

esse; and I withheld the delivery of the commission.  They cannot issue a

mandamus to the president, or legislature, or to any of their officers."*

It is true, that the constitution does not authorize the Supreme Court to

issue a mandamus in the exercise of original jurisdiction, as was the case

in Marbury v. Madison; and it was so decided by the Supreme Court. But the

Act of Congress of 1789, ch. 20, § 13, had actually conferred the very

power on the Supreme Court., by providing, that the Supreme Court shall

have power "to issue writs of mandamus, &amp;c. to any courts appointed, or

persons holding office under the authority of the United States."  So, that

the Supreme Court, in declining jurisdiction, in effect declared, that the

act of congress was, in this respect, unconstitutional.  But no lawyer

could doubt, that congress might confer the power on any other court; and

the Supreme Court itself might issue a mandamus in the exercise of its

appellate jurisdiction.  But the whole argument of President Jefferson

proceeds on an assumption, which is not proved.  He says, delivery is

essential to a deed.  But, assuming this to be correct in all cases, it

does not establish, that a commission is essential to every appointment, or

that a commission must, by the constitution, be by a deed; or that an

appointment to office is not complete, before the commission is sealed, or

delivered. The question is not, whether a deed at the common law is perfect

without a delivery; but whether an appointment under the constitution is

perfect without a delivery of a commission.  If a delivery were necessary,

when the president had signed the commission, and delivered it to the

secretary to be sealed and recorded, such delivery would be * 4 Jefferson's Corresp. 317;  Id. 75; Id. 372, 373.  sufficient, for it is the final act required to be done by the president.

But, in point of fact, the seat is not the seal of the president, but of

the United States.  The commission, sealed by the president, is not his

deed; and it does not take effect, as his deed.  It is merely a

verification of his act by the highest evidence.  The doctrine, then, of

deeds of private persons, at the common law, is inapplicable.  It is

painful to observe in President Jefferson's writings, the constant

insinuations against public men and public bodies, who differ from his own

opinions or measures, of being governed by improper or unworthy motives, or

mere party spirit.  The very letters here cited (4 Jefferson's Corresp. 75,

317, 372) afford illustrations, not to be mistaken; and certainly diminish

the value, which might otherwise be attributed to his criticisms.</li>

Washington, and President John Adams was, for the president, at the opening

of each session of congress to meet both Houses in person, and deliver a

speech to them, containing his views on public affairs, and his

recommendations of measures.  On other occasions he simply addressed

written messages to them, or either of them, according to the nature of the

message.  To the speeches thus made a written answer was given by each

house; and thus an opportunity was afforded by the opponents of the

administration to review its whole policy in a single debate on the answer.

That practice was discontinued by President Jefferson, who addressed all

his communications to congress by written messages; and to these no answers

were returned.* The practice thus introduced by him has been ever since

exclusively pursued by all succeeding presidents, whether for the better

has been gravely doubted by some of our most distinguished statesmen. * Rawle on Const. ch. 16, p. 171, 172, 173.</li>

<li><a id="135"></a> In consequence of President Jackson's Message, negativing the Bank of

the United States, July 10, 1832, in which be advances the doctrine, that

the decisions made by other departments of the government, including the

Judiciary, and even by his predecessors in office in approving laws, are

not obligatory on him; the question has been a good deal agitated by

statesmen and constitutional lawyers.  The following extract from a letter,

written by Mr. Madison to Mr. C. J. Ingersoll, on 25th of June, 1831,

contains reasoning on this subject, worthy of the judgment of that great

man. "The charge of inconsistency between my objection to the constitutionality

of such a bank, in 1791, and my assent, in 1817, turns to the question how

far legislative precedents, expounding the constitution, ought to guide

succeeding legislatures, and to overrule individual opinions. "Some obscurity has been thrown over the question, by confounding  it with the respect due from one legislature, to laws passed by preceding

legislatures.  But the two cases are essentially different.  A

constitution, being derived from a superior authority, is to be expounded

and obeyed, not controlled or varied by the subordinate authority of a

legislature.  A law, on the other hand, resting on no higher authority,

than that possessed by every successive legislature; its expediency, as

well as its meaning, is within the scope of the latter.
   
    "The case in question has its true analogy, in the obligation arising from

judicial expositions of the law on succeeding judges, the constitution

being a law to the legislator, as the law is a rule of decision to the

judge. "And why are judicial precedents, when formed on due discussion and

consideration, and deliberately sanctioned by reviews and repetitions, regar

ded as of binding influence, or rather of authoritative force, in settling

the meaning of a law? It must be answered, 1st, because it is a reasonable

and established axiom, and the good of society requires, that the rules of

conduct of its members, should be certain and known, which would not be the

case if any judge, disregarding the decisions of his predecessors, should

vary the rule of law, according to his individual interpretation of it.

Misera est servitus ubi jus aut vagum aut incognitum.  2d, because an

exposition of the law publicly made, and repeatedly confirmed by the

constituted authority, carries with it, by fair inference, the sanction of

those, who, having made the law through their legislative organ, appear

under such circumstances, to have determined its meaning through their

judiciary organ. "Can it be of less consequence, that the meaning of a constitution should

be fixed and known, than that the meaning of a law should be so?  Can,

indeed, a law be fixed in its meaning and operation, unless the

constitution be so?  On the contrary, if a particular legislature,

differing in the construction of the constitution, from a series of

preceding constructions, proceed to act on that difference, they not only

introduce uncertainty and instability in the constitution, but in the laws

themselves; inasmuch as all laws, preceding the new construction, and

inconsistent with it, are not only annulled for the future, but virtually

pronounced nullities from the beginning. "But, it is said, that the legislator, having sworn to support the

constitution, must support it in his own construction of it, however

different from that put on by his predecessors, or whatever be the

consequences of the construction.  And is not the judge under the same oath

to support the law? yet, has it ever been supposed, that he was required,

or at liberty, to disregard all precedents, however solemnly repeated and

regularly observed; and by giving effect to his own abstract and individual

opinions, to disturb the established course of practice, in the business of

the community? Has the wisest and most conscientious judge ever scrupled to

acquiesce in decisions, in which he  has been overruled by the matured opinions of the majority or his

colleagues; and subsequently to conform himself thereto, as to

authoritative expositions of the law?  And is it not reasonable, that the

same view of the official oath should be taken by a legislator, acting

under the constitution, which is his guide, as.is token by a judge, acting

under the law, which is his?
   
    "There is, in fact and in common understanding, a necessity of regarding a

course of practice, as above characterized, in the light of a legal rule of

interpreting a law: end there is a like necessity of considering it a

constitutional rule of interpreting a constitution. "That there may be extraordinary and peculiar circumstances controlling

the rule in both cases, may be admitted; but with such exceptions, the rule

will force itself on the practical judgment of the most ardent theorist.

He will find it impossible to adhere to, and act officially upon his

solitary opinions, as to the meaning of the law or constitution, in

opposition to a construction reduced to practice, during a reasonable

period of time; more especially, where no prospect existed of a change of

construction, by the public or its agents.  And if a reasonable period of

time, marked with the usual sanctions, would not bar the individual

prerogative, there could be no limitation to its exercise, although the

danger of error must increase with the increasing oblivion of explanatory

circumstances, and with the continual changes in the import of words and

phrases. "Let it then be left to the decision of every intelligent and candid

judge, which, on the whole, is most to be relied on for the true and safe

construction of a constitution; that which has the uniform sanction of

successive legislative bodies through a period of years, and under the

varied ascendancy of parties; or that which depends upon the opinions of

every new legislature, heated as it may be by the spirit of party, eager in

the pursuit or some favourite object, or led astray by the eloquence and

address of popular statesmen, themselves, perhaps, under the influence of

the same misleading causes. "It was in conformity with the view here token, of the respect due to

deliberate and reiterated precedents, that the bank of the United States,

though on the original question held to be unconstitutional, received the

executive signature in the year 1817.  The act originally establishing a

bank, had undergone ample discussions in its passage through the several

branches of the government.  It had been carried into execution throughout

a period of twenty years, with annual legislative recognitions; in one

instance, indeed, with a positive ramification of it into a new state; and

with the entire acquiescence of all the local authorities, as well as of

the nation at large; to all of which may be added a decreasing prospect of

any change in the public opinion, adverse to the constitutionality of such

an institution.  A veto from the executive under these circumstances; with

an admission of.the expediency and almost necessity of the measure, would

have been a  defiance of all the obligations derived from a course of precedents,

amounting to the requisite evidence of the national judgment and intention.
   
    "It has been contended that the authority or precedents was in that case

invalidated, by the consideration, that they proved only a respect for the

stipulated duration of the bank, with a toleration of it, until the law

should expire; and by the casting vote given in the senate by the

Vice-President, in 1811, against a bill for establishing a National Bank,

the vote being expressly given on the ground of unconstitutionality. But if

the law itself was unconstitutional, the stipulation was void, and could

not be constitutionally fulfilled or tolerated.  And as to the negative or

the senate, by the casting vote of the presiding officer; it is a fact well

understood at the time, that it resulted not from an equality of opinions

in that assembly, on the power or congress to establish a bank, but from a

junction of those, who admitted the power, but disapproved the plan, with

those who denied the power.  On a simple question of constitutionality,

there was a decided majority in favour of it" There is also a very cogent argument, on the same side, in Mr. Webster's

Speech in the senate, in July, 1832, on the Veto Message of the President.</li>
