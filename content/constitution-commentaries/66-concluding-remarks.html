§ 1903.
</b>
We have now reviewed all the
provisions of the original constitution of the United States, and all the
amendments, which have been incorporated into it. And, here, the task originally
proposed in these Commentaries is brought to a close. Many reflections naturally
crowd upon the mind at such a moment; many grateful recollections of the past;
and many anxious thoughts of the future. The past is secure. It is unalterable.
The seal of eternity is upon it. The wisdom, which it has displayed, and the
blessings, which it has bestowed, cannot be obscured; neither can they be
debased by human folly, or human infirmity. The future is that, which may well
awaken the most earnest solicitude, both for the virtue and the permanence of
our republic. The fate of other republics, their rise, their progress, their
decline, and their fall, are written but too legibly on the pages of history, if
indeed they were not continually before us in the startling fragments of their
ruins. They have perished; and perished by their own hands. Prosperity has
enervated them, corruption has debased them, and a venal populace has
consummated their destruction. Alternately the prey of military chieftains at
home, and of ambitious invaders from abroad, they have been sometimes cheated
out of their liberties by servile demagogues; sometimes betrayed into a
surrender of them by false patriots; and sometimes they have willingly sold them
for a price to the despot, who has bidden highest for his victims. They have
disregarded the warning voice of their best statesmen; and have persecuted, and
driven from office their truest friends. They have listened to the fawning
sycophant, and the base calumniator of the wise and the good. They have
reverenced power more in its high abuses and summary movements, than in its calm
and constitutional energy, when it dispensed blessings with an unseen, but
liberal hand. They have surrendered to faction, what belonged to the country.
Patronage and party, the triumph of a leader, and the discontents of a day, have
outweighed all solid principles and institutions of government. Such are the
melancholy lessons of the past history of republics down to our own.

§ 1904.
</b>
It is not my design to detain the
reader by any elaborate reflections addressed to his judgment, either by way of
admonition or of encouragement. But it may not be wholly without use to glance
at one or two considerations, upon which our meditations cannot be too
frequently indulged.

§ 1905.
</b>
In the first place, it cannot
escape our notice, how exceedingly difficult it is to settle the foundations of
any government upon principles, which do not admit of controversy or question.
The, very elements, out of which it is to be built, are susceptible of infinite
modifications; and theory too often deludes us by the attractive simplicity of
its plans, and imagination by the visionary perfection of its speculations. In
theory, a government may promise the most perfect harmony of operations in all
its various combinations. In practice, the whole machinery may be perpetually
retarded, or thrown out of order by accidental mal-adjustments. In theory, a
government may seem deficient in unity of design and symmetry of parts; and yet,
in practice, it may work with astonishing accuracy and force for the general
welfare. Whatever, then, has been found to work well in experience, should be
rarely hazarded upon conjectural improvements. Time, and long and steady
operation are indispensable to the perfection of all social institutions. To be
of any value they must become cemented with the habits, the feelings, and the
pursuits of the people. Every change discomposes for a while the whole
arrangements of the system. What is safe is not always expedient; what is new is
often pregnant with unforeseen evils, and imaginary good.

§ 1906.
</b>
In the next place, the slightest
attention to the history of the national constitution must satisfy every
reflecting mind, how many difficulties attended its formation and adoption, from
real or imaginary differences of interests, sectional feelings, and local
institutions. It is an attempt to create a national sovereignty, and yet to
preserve the state sovereignties; though it is impossible to assign definite
boundaries in every case to the powers of each. The influence of the disturbing
causes, which, more than once in the convention, were on the point of breaking
up the Union, have since immeasurably increased in concentration and vigour. The
very inequalities of a government, confessedly founded in a compromise, were
then felt with a strong sensibility; and every new source of discontent, whether
accidental or permanent, has since added increased activity to the painful sense
of these inequalities. The North cannot but perceive, that it has yielded to the
South a superiority of representatives, already amounting to twenty-five, beyond
its due proportion; and the South imagines, that, with all this preponderance in
representation, the other parts of the Union enjoy a more perfect protection of
their interests, than her own. The West feels her growing power and weight in
the Union; and the Atlantic states begin to learn, that the sceptre must one day
depart from them. If, under these circumstances, the Union should once be broken
up, it is impossible, that a new constitution should ever be formed, embracing
the whole Territory. We shall be divided into several nations or confederacies,
rivals in power and interest, too proud to brook injury, and too close to make
retaliation distant or ineffectual. Our very animosities will, like those of all
other kindred nations, become more deadly, because our lineage, laws, and
language are the same. Let the history of the Grecian and Italian republics warn
us of our dangers. The national constitution is our last, and our only security.
United we stand; divided we fall.

§ 1907.
</b>
If these Commentaries shall but
inspire in the rising generation a more ardent love of their country, an
unquenchable thirst for liberty, and a profound reverence for the constitution
and the Union, then they will have accomplished all, that their author ought to
desire. Let the American youth never forget, that they possess a noble
inheritance, bought by the toils, and sufferings, and blood of their ancestors;
and capable, if wisely improved, and faithfully guarded, of transmitting to
their latest posterity all the substantial blessings of fife, the peaceful
enjoyment of liberty, property, religion, and independence. The structure has
been erected by architects of consummate skill and fidelity; its foundations are
solid; its compartments are beautiful, as well as useful; its arrangements are
full of wisdom and order; and its defences are impregnable from without. It has
been reared for immortality, if the work of man may justly aspire to such a
title. It may, nevertheless, perish in an hour by the folly, or corruption, or
negligence of its only keepers,

THE PEOPLE

</b>
.
Republics are created by the virtue, public spirit, and intelligence of the
citizens. They fall, when the wise are banished from the public councils,
because they dare to be honest, and the profligate are rewarded, because they
flatter the people, in order to betray them.
